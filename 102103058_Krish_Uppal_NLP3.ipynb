    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

After his landlady Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), a retired schoolteacher, commits suicide due to being swindled out of $2 million, Clay embarks on a mission for vengeance. His journey pits him against a web of corruption involving Mickey Garnett (David Witts), a call center scammer, and Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson), a tech executive implicated in global scam operations. The plot thickens with the involvement of former CIA director Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons) and FBI agent Verona Parker (Emmy Raver-Lampman), Eloise’s daughter, intertwining federal agencies, covert operations, and personal vendettas. The narrative escalates to a dramatic showdown at the U.S. President’s mansion, where Clay confronts Danforth and ultimately escapes, leaving a trail of destruction and unresolved moral ambiguities in his quest for justice.* * *(INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING)(HORNETS BUZZING)(SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)(HORNETS BUZZING)(DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS)(MUSIC STOPS)(BIRDS CHIRPING)That’s them in there just like that?Just like that.I wouldn’t go in there for a day or two.Heard the expression kick the hornet’s nest?I’ll stay right here.

I’m not a computer person.What did you say the name of your product is again?(BEES BUZZING)Now, our records show that you actually have an older version on your account.So what I’m going to need you to do is uninstall that and install the latest version.Well, I have no idea how to do that.My daughter set up everything for me.Well, I would recommend you take your computer to an IT specialist.However, keep in mind that you will lose all your data, since they’ll have to replace the hard drive.I’m pretty remote out here.Everything I have is on the computer.Okay.

Cease to matter.Used to be a part of life, of the family.Part of the hive, I guess you could say.There’s some British Isles hiding in your accent.I was born there.I hated that she was out here alone.She wouldn’t leave.(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)There’s too many memories.You know, I think I know why she liked you.You’re just like my brother.He was in MARSOC, a Marine Raider.He was killed a few years ago kicking doors.(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) She loved him.He’d mow the lawn and you’d think he invented fire. (CHUCKLES)You know, while I graduated the FBI Academy and she said, “Oh, that’s nice.”She got scammed.Somebody emptied out all her accounts, her savings, her retirement.Got every penny. Maxed out all her cards.She was an educator, director of a charity for kids.They got two million out of that account.You know who did it?(SIGHS)I talked to an agent in our cybercrimes office.This crew’s been operating for two years and we don’t even have names.And even if we did, good luck building an indictment that would stand up in court.Some defense attorney would just argue that the elderly victim agreed to wire a complete stranger his entire life savings.Taking from an elderly person is as bad as stealing from a child.Maybe worse.Someone hurts a child, there are parents.People who care, ready to step in.Someone hurts an older person… sometimes they’re left to face the hornets alone.Because either it goes unnoticed… or no one cares.I care.And I’m stubborn.And so help me God, I’m going to get these motherfuckers who did this.I need to take care of the hive.(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)You’ve been up all night.CLAY: The hive is more important.(DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)(CELL PHONE BEEPING)(LINE RINGS, CONNECTS)What are you doing?I thought you retired.CLAY: I did.I need a favor.What kind of favor?A name and address.Easy.Not easy.Even the FBI can’t find these people.Well, we’re not the FBI, are we?Shoot me the deets and stand by.(CELL PHONE BEEPS)Yeah.You weren’t kidding.

No bees, no agriculture.No agriculture, no civilization.Our nation is not unlike a beehive, with its complex systems of workers,caretakers, even royalty.If any of the beehive’s complex mechanisms are compromised, the hive collapses.Someone a long time ago decided that a mechanism was needed to keep our nation safe.A mechanism outside the chain of command, outside the system.Its one mission, to keep the system safe.Beekeepers are given all resources, empowered to act on their own judgment.For decades, they have quietly worked to keep the hive safe.That is, until now.It appears that a retired Beekeeper has gone off program and is acting in what he mistakenly believes is the hive’s best interest.MAN: Can’t somebody just pick up the phone and tell this yahoo to standthefuck down?That’s the one thing Beekeepers don’t do.Stand down.Not unlike bees themselves, Beekeepers keep working until they die.So he’s basically one of us.No. He’s not like you.You’re tier one operators, former SEAL Team Six, Delta Group.You are, in other words, pussies.(INDISTINCT CHATTER)If you were in the same room, he would kill you.With enough of you, then maybe you just might in fact be able to kill him before he accomplishes his goal.What would that be?To kill his way to the top of the hive.Mr. Pettis, you should get your people moving.(DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS)(MUSIC FADES OUT)Dude, bees are interesting little shits.Did you know that?I know they pollinate a bunch of shit and we’d be fucked without them.Listen.“Some bees are queen slayers, which will rise up and kill their queen if she fails to produce the right kind of male offspring.”Fascinating.(TELEPHONE RINGING)No. (CLEARS THROAT)Hm.

Yes. Not that Beekeepers exist.But Mr. Clay does keep honey bees.He admires their willingness to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.Our concern is that Clay believes that Derek Danforth is the defective offspring of a queen, thereby Clay will strike at the heart of the problem and become a queen slayer.Adam Clay’s next victim is Derek Danforth’s mother?President Danforth, sir.You have a blank check.

The film portrays the complex personal and professional life of Ferrari, founder of the renowned car manufacturer, during the pivotal summer of 1957. FeaturingAdam Driverin the lead role, with notable performances by Penélope Cruz, Shailene Woodley, and others, the film premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival and was later released theatrically in the U.S. by Neon on December 25, 2023. Acclaimed by critics, it grossed $36 million worldwide and was recognized as one of the top films of 2023 by the National Board of Review.Plot summary:During the summer of 1957, Enzo Ferrari, the famed Italian businessman, gears up his team for the Mille Miglia, a challenging thousand-mile endurance race. Amidst personal and business turmoil, Ferrari and his wife, Laura, still mourn the loss of their only son, Dino, who passed away a year earlier. Keeping his unfaithfulness from Laura, Enzo faces pressure from his mistress, Lina Lardi, to acknowledge their son, Piero, with the Ferrari surname as his confirmation approaches.Concurrently, Ferrari’s company struggles financially, despite the innovative development of their Formula One car. The only solution appears to be a merger, but this is complicated by Laura owning half of Ferrari’s shares. To proceed with the merger, Enzo must persuade Laura to relinquish her shares to him. Discovering Enzo’s affair and the existence of Piero, a betrayed Laura demands a $500,000 check, risking the company’s solvency. Trusting Laura’s discretion, Enzo complies.At the Mille Miglia in Brescia, Ferrari motivates his drivers to outperform their rivals. Tragically, Alfonso de Portago, a new team member, foregoes a tire change in Rome to maintain the lead, leading to a fatal crash that claims his life, his navigator’s, and nine spectators. Despite Taruffi, another of Ferrari’s drivers, winning the race, the media blames Ferrari for de Portago’s death. Laura uses the check to silence the press and signs over her shares to Enzo, on the condition that Piero not bear the Ferrari name until after her passing. Enzo agrees and later takes Piero to visit his half-brother’s grave.* * ** * *[“Febbre Della Giungla” playing][singing in Italian][song ends]EX RACER ENZO FERRARI AND HIS WIFE LAURA STARTED AUTO COSTRUZIONI FERRARI IN THE RUINS OF POST-WAR ITALY IN 19471957[birds chirping][kisses][sighs][car engine rumbles][engine revs][passengers chattering][announcer speaking Italian on loudspeaker][telephone ringing][ringing continues]Yes?Please inform Signor Ferrari that the Maserati driver Jean Behra has just arrived from Milan.Hmm.

But the rule is that you have to be here before the maid arrives with the morning coffee. That was the agreement, was it not?Laura, please.Buongiorno, signora, Commendatore.[telephone ringing]Pronto.[Ferrari] Eugenio, my boy.Commendatore.Can you be at the Modena Autodrome by 11:00? Bring your lucky gloves.What gloves?The gloves that will beat Behra, who’s come to steal from you our record.I’ll be there.Good.[maid] Will that be all, signora? That’ll be all.Laura, the car broke.[gasps]What’s going on in there?Her gentleness, the signora, is trying to shoot the Commendatore.Buongiorno, Peppino. I let him live.That gun was given to you for your protection.And talk to Cuoghi. You’re going broke.I knew it would come to this. You gave her a gun, she’ll use it.She carries the payroll for the factory around in that handbag.I’d rearm Germany before I gave that woman a gun.Peppino will take you and Laura to the cemetery this morning.And don’t forget the Workers Mass unless you want to pay higher wages next year.Don’t fight with Laura.Mm.Good morning.No one was hurt, so don’t make a fuss.What? What have I said?[bell tolling]Morning, Commendatore.Good morning.[customer] Did you know who was in the car? It was Jean Behra.Don’t panic, Matteo. If they take the record, we shall take it back. How did our football team do yesterday?You know damn well. We lost.Oh, one long catalog of disaster it’s been. How long since you took over?What about Le Mans? Jaguar one, two and three. What’s that?Well, from my mistakes I learn, whereas the mistakes you make you repeat, week after week. When you play Bologna, I hope you win. Otherwise I have to relocate the factory so the drivers are not dispirited by living in a city whose football team dwells in the perpetual twilight of failure.The Modena Football Club is the pride of Emilia.[all scoff, laugh]Cuoghi wants to meet. That means bad news. [sighs] Now, your mother missed on purpose. One day she won’t, and then I’ll be in here with you. [exhales] I’m hearing voices in my sleep again. My brother. And my father. No, I see their faces too. But also now, Campari and Borzacchini, my two good friends who died on the same day 24 years ago this week at Monza on that evil afternoon. … Ghosts. … There was a time I loved your mother… beyond reason. Well, she was a different creature then. But so was I. And I see you too, you know. Every moment I close my eyes. …[sobs]Your face I want to see.[sniffles]Okay. Okay. [sighs] I go to deal with today.[engine stops][car engine starts]Did I tell you of my son Alfredo, Enzo’s older brother?Many times, signora.A tragedy. I lost him in the Great War.Yes, signora.Let me tell you, the wrong son died.[chuckles softly][bell tolling][sobs softly][choir singing “Jesu, Rex admirabilis”][bell ringing][bishop] If Jesus had lived today and not two thousand years ago, he would have been born in a small town like Modena. He would have been not a carpenter but a craftsman in metal like yourselves.

How it can be forged, shaped and hammered by your skills into an engine, holding inside a fire to make power to speed us through the world.

Call my office on Monday.I woke you.No, I was up.Did I wake the boy?Let me.[sniffs]You haven’t said a word.What is there to say? The newspapers, the radio, they have it all.They do? Was he your friend, the young Castellotti? Or was it your fault? The car’s fault? His fault? Will you miss him?Does that bring the boy back? Why do you push like that?Why do you think? I know it matters to you.To me? Come on. Twenty-four years ago this week, I lost two friends. Campari and Borzacchini. At Monza, in the metal I made. So I knew then it was, “Enzo, build a wall.”Or?Or, “Enzo, go do something else.”[sniffs]“Ferrari is an industrial Saturn devouring his own children. First Tornaco, now Castellotti.” If you continue killing the nation’s heroes, we’ll have to go to America and live among foreigners.I did not kill Castellotti.The papers blame you.It wasn’t me. If anyone, it was his mother. It’s true. He was engaged to Cecilia Manzini. His mother wanted him to marry a woman with more class. As a result of the weight she put on his shoulders, he became distracted, he lost his concentration, he crashed and died.He blames the mother!What I’m saying is, when a mother interferes in this business, death usually follows.Call the bank. Cancel Castellotti’s salary. And call Chiti. I need a report on the car for the insurers.Yes, signora.There’s Ferrari.Why is the damn top down?I didn’t want to get it wet.It belongs to King Hussein. Get it inside. And make sure the cockpit’s dry before you hand it over.[test driver] Yes, sir, Commendatore.Stall the king and tell them to get a move on in the shop.Yes, Commendatore.So?You’re going broke. Laura’s right.How?How? You spend more than you make, that’s how.The production cars pay for the racing.I could run Portugal on what you spend on racing. How many production cars did you make last year?Uh, 140, 150.Ninety-eight.198.No. Ninety-eight.So what do I do?Find a partner.I have a partner. My wife. She is very mean with money.A real partner. Like Agnelli at Fiat or Henry Ford. Someone who has capital to pump in.No. Impossible. With money, they want control. I must have total control.The right partner would help with the production cars, while you do what you like with the racing. Increase production to 400 customer cars a year. Attract finance. Then you can negotiate.How do we make-never mind how do we sell-400 customer cars a year?Jaguar took the first three places at Le Mans. Now their sales books are full. You win on Sunday, you sell on Monday. You already have kings waiting in line.Mm, Jaguar. Jaguar races only to sell cars. I sell cars only to be racing. We are completely different organisms.Survive, or you are no organism.[telephone ringing] Hello. I am Alfonso de Portago. I have an appointment with Signor Ferrari.Take a seat, please.Win the Mille Miglia, Enzo. Attract outside finance. Or you are out of business.[secretary] Signor Ferrari, this is Don Alfonso–Yeah, I know who it is. Cuoghi!The Marquis de Portago![door opens]Hey, Ferrari!Cuoghi! One more thing. How did Laura get her hands on the freehold to the plant? The Nazis were about to arrest me. I put it in her name along with half the shares. We built it together.Get it back. If you face up to Agnelli or Ford, you have to hold all the cards.Well, it’s easier said than done.[Hussein] Ferrari!Ah.Your Majesty!One more thing. If I’m in bad shape, what of Maserati?Worse. I give them six months. They’ve gone to the French for finance. And they, too, will try to prove themselves at the Mille Miglia. Everyone’s eye will be on it. Only one team will win. Make sure it’s you.Your Highness!Which Highness?That Highness. You, get out to the track. Your Majesty, come this way.I hope you got my measurements right. Last time my feet could barely touch the pedals.Of course.[shutter clicks][shutter clicks]He drives like Varzi.[tires squeal][engine stops][De Portago grunts]Well, how did I do?[Ferrari] You drive like Varzi. Your duties will include testing and road racing.[De Portago] The Mille Miglia?You’ll drive a works 250. Not the most powerful car, but reliable and it goes like hell round corners, so I’ll expect you to be in the points. Actresses. I have admiration, but keep them away from the paddock. They distract photographers, whose attention I want on my cars. Understand? Okay.[Ferrari] Peter.[Collins chuckles]Look after our new driver. He’s wet and hungry.Hello, Fon.How do you do?Pa.

What we need is more power. You hear that, Chiti?But they turn quick.And have no straight-line speed.And the English, they have a new invention called brakes, unlike my 250.[laughter][Ferrari] All right. To de Portago.[all] Cheers.[Ferrari] To de Portago’s hair.[laughter]Don’t you think?Fon! Are you running around like that?Oh! [moans][laughs][continues laughing][Lina sighs][chuckles softly]What’s so funny?Uh… I wondered when you’d be back.How can I stay away? It’s the plums.[scoffs]Where’s Piero?On his way home from school. He asked me yesterday.What?“Am I Piero Lardi or Piero Ferrari?”[door opens, closes][Piero] Papa! Have you got it?The autograph. No. Oh. He hasn’t, uh, had a proper picture taken yet.What autograph?De Portago. From Spain.He’s going to drive for me.Great.Why do you like him so much?He drives like Varzi. I’m going to be a driver. Like you.No, not like me. I only won a few races. This is much better.Why?Okay. Pretend you’re inside this engine. In the intake manifold. Right here. Really pretend. You’re tiny. The size of a little ant. Now look up. It’s silver. What do you see?A big tunnel.Like a pipe, yes? Now pretend water races through. And when it hits this side, what does it do?Some will splash sideways.But if I make the curve more gentle, more slippery, what does it do?It will go faster.Fuel and air will move faster just like the water. And that is all an engine does. Moves fuel in, sparks them into rapid expansion, moves old gases out, new fuel in. And the faster it can do that, the more power you make.It looks better.Does it? I have a secret to tell you. In all life, when a thing works better, usually it is more beautiful to the eye.[chuckles][Lina] Piero, go wash up.Mmm. Are you staying to eat?I’ll sit with you and Piero.Will you come back after?It depends. I’ll try.Mm, depends on what?On how business with her goes.[grunts, sighs] I’m too easy.What do you mean?Too modern. I should give you lots of shit like a normal Italian woman.I prefer you like you are.Oh, I’m sure you do. What I should become is the mistress. “Oh, Enzo! I feel so sad. Buy me a fur coat and a diamond necklace.” Piero! Sit down. Don’t worry. I do not plan to change who I am.Thank you.Thank you? For nothing. It’s not for you.Do you know the hardest part of my life with you?There is none.There is.What?Being away. While with me-what do the English say? A piece of pie?Cake, Enzo. And you’re not.[Ferrari] Thank you, Alda. Those are from Cuoghi. He says our days are numbered unless we find a new partner. One of the big companies. Fiat or Ford.No.You’ve never had a boss. You won’t like it.In order to attract this partner, he says we have to expand. He’s talking about building 400 cars a year.How do we sell 400 cars a year?We have to win the Mille Miglia, then orders for sports cars will follow.This man knows contract law. What does he know about motor racing? Hmm? A thousand miles across bad roads with sheep and dogs. Anything can happen. What else? What else?You should assign me control of your stock in the company and the freehold, uh, so I can deal.Oh. Because Henry Ford won’t deal with a woman.No. Because if it comes to a deal, it’ll be hard and fast. I have to have all the cards in my hand.Well, half the cards are in my hand.Laura. What do you want me to say? “Mr. Ford, we have a deal, but first I must wait until I ask my wife for permission”?Yes, you can say that. You know what? I’m gonna give you power of attorney over my stock, so you can deal.For half a million dollars.I don’t have half a million!You will if you make a deal.Okay, I’ll give you a check. Post-dated.Not post-dated.I’ll give you a check on condition you promise not to cash it until and unless the deal goes through. Is that reasonable? … Is that reasonable? We need this.One condition.What?I want my gun back.What?I want my gun back.[Ferrari moans][Laura moaning][Ferrari panting][shouts][table thumping]Did you sign de Portago?Yes.I’ll draw up a contract.And I need money for Cecilia Manzini.How much money?25,000.What? 25,000?She’s broke.

She’ll have the use of it, but we’ll retain the freehold.Ah, the same arrangement as in, uh, Castelvetro.Castelvetro? We have a property in Castelfranco.[bank manager] Oh. Yes, yes. I’m sorry. I got the towns confused. [chuckles]I also need a banker’s order for a new driver. His name is de Portago.How do you spell that?D-E-P-O-R-T-A-G-O.Thank you.Thank you.[sighs deeply]Castelvetro.As her gentleness, the signora, commands.Commendatore! The press conference.[telephone ringing][Ferrari chuckles] He’s dating Linda Christian, that blonde who follows him around.Who is?De Portago. Tyrone Power left Rita Hayworth for the blonde. She left Tyrone Power for de Portago.What are you reading, Commendatore?“Rome Merry-Go-Round.”Here’s who will be there. And I will exclude Di Massimo and Fusaro. They are the worst.No, no, no. I want them there.So what do you think?[sighs] Ah, there is no ashtray.Are you a prima donna?You ever tried flicking ash out of a car at 200 kilometers an hour?I’m offering you a brand-new car which has the edge on Maserati.Bullshit. The Maserati is faster and it has an ashtray.If I put in an ashtray, will you drive it in the Mille Miglia?[sighs]Good. And don’t ask me for a navigator.Wha–You know every inch. You’ve raced it 16 times. I can see in your eyes you’re going to ask me, and I’m not seduced by you, silver fox. Get all these cleaned up before the photo call.How’d she handle?Good.This is not, “How was lunch?” “Good.” I want to know brake wear. I want steering, suspension, gear ratios, final drive. If it’s going to run in the Mille Miglia, it’s got to be 100%. Here, talk to him.[assistant] Go. Get inside.[journalists chattering]Okay, Di Massimo.Signor Ferrari.I’m not an assassin.It was a figure of speech. Uh, Commendato[Ferrari] Out![Di Massimo] Commendatore.Out. Fusaro. You said I was Saturn devouring his young children.I was merely quoting the Vatican, Commendatore.You too. Out.[journalists grumbling]And you, Moretti. A “widow-maker.” For the record, Castellotti was not married, okay? Out.When we win, I can’t see my cars for shots of starlets’ asses. When we lose, you’re a lynch mob.[journalists protesting]It’s enough to make the pope weep. Next. Let me introduce my spring team for the Mille Miglia.[journalists clamoring] Signor Ferrari! Ferrari![Ferrari] This is de Portago, Castellotti’s replacement. But he drives like Varzi.Hey, Fon, is it true about Linda Christian? She’s your girlfriend?Don’t answer that question. This is my old friend Taruffi. Last time he was second. This time he will be first. Peter Collins. Future world champion. Taffy von Trips. A tiger. And this is Olivier Gendebien, the fastest driver of road cars in the world.[journalists clamoring][camera flashes firing][photographer 1] Yes, all together.[photographer 2] Smile. A smile.

A word after.[photographer 4] Smile!Hey, Linda!Stop. Stop. Go back. Go back. … Turn right.[Ferrari] Giuseppe. Rancati, there’s something I want you to do for me. Write an article suggesting that there are rumors that I’m talking to Henry Ford II about the future of the factory. At the end, say you asked me, bluntly, and that I categorically denied it.And are you? Categorically denying it?Ah, yes, of course. Categorically, I deny it.If I write this article, will you give me an exclusive on your private life?Yes. If you promise not to publish it.For the time being.Until I authorize it.Okay. It’s a deal.[engine stops][car door closes]You’re going tonight?Yes. With my friends.He’s quiet. I didn’t get him de Portago’s autograph.It’s not about that.What is it about?In two weeks, he’ll be confirmed. As whom? Piero Lardi or Piero Ferrari? We said when he was ten, we would sort this out. Then Dino’s illness got worse, and he’s still Piero Lardi. I’m out of excuses.Postpone the confirmation.His whole class is being confirmed.Say he lost his faith in God.Enzo. Who else knows about him?Nobody. Apart from the chief of police.The doctor?Well, yes, the doctor.And Piero’s teachers.The teachers.Tavoni, Sergio.Of course, Tavoni.And the bank manager?The bank manager.Enzo.Apart from them, no one.Enzo, this is Italy. Yes? All of Modena knows!',\n",

Oh, you’re going to tell me, “Enzo, don’t be so bourgeois, so Italian.”Don’t make me sound like a beatnik.You read French books.What happened between us in the war happened. As with many. And sometimes I wish it didn’t.How can you say that?Because if I was a woman like I am now, not 12 years ago, I would not have interfered in another woman’s marriage. And now she’s lost a child. But the present is what the present is. And in our world here, between me and you and Piero, what is best for Piero? Who speaks for him? You’re his father.How do we reconcile this?I don’t know. But that makes it no less.[faint singing in Italian on television]Aren’t you coming?No. Make an excuse for me.The cash for Cecilia?Brown envelope by the door.[door closes]What’s this I hear about you looking for outside investors? Fangio eating up all your money?No. With television, it’s going to become big business. To do this, one has to be capitalized. The game is changing, Enzo.And this outside capital will magically bestow its favors upon Maserati.[chuckling] Of course. After we win the Mille Miglia.[crowd quiets][applause][tenor singing “Parigi, o cara”][singing “Parigi, o cara”][both laughing][grunts][laughing][soprano continues singing][Laura clapping]I’m pregnant.[commentator] Hawthorn is third, Fangio and Collins…[Ferrari] Where is everybody?[cork pops][Scaglietti] I gave them the day off.[Ferrari] No wonder you’re so late with everything.Enzo, it’s Sunday. My men work weekends all through the year for you.[groans]Their children haven’t seen them since the day they were born.That’s very sad. Here’s to you and that pack of color-blind louts you employ.De Portago is slowing down, having overshot on the braking. Mrs. Vanderbilt and Cooper watch excitedly as Lewis-Evans goes through in the straight followed by Musso’s Ferrari. Vanwall leads the race, averaging 120 miles per hour. Musso makes his tires smoke as he strains all his nerves to try and close down the gap. We got word of a collision between the BRM and the Cooper-Climax. Oh! There is a lot of smoke, making it very–[tires squeal][crowd cheering, whistling][mechanic] What is problema?[speaking Italian][straining][mechanic] Oh, no. [grunts]Is she operable?Ah, that’s bad. Bad, bad. Very bad.With three laps to go, after Fangio, Musso, it’s Behra and de Portago. He’s trying all he knows to close the gap. De Portago! And he brakes first!Call in de Portago.Hurry up. Hurry up.[Tavoni] Fon. Fon.What?[Tavoni] Out.What?Out! Peter’s taking over.Thank you, old bean.Go, go, go!What happened?I could have taken him.[Ferrari] You lack commitment. Look at the Maserati team. Fangio. Behra. Stirling Moss. Hard-nosed pros. Men with a brutal determination to win. With a cruel emptiness in their stomachs. Detachment. Loyal to one thing-not the team. Loyal to their lust to win. It rains. The track is slippery with oil, an evil-handling car. Will they falter? No. My spring team. Courageous? Skillful? Yes. Recently in school. Aristocrats, straight from Almanach de Gotha. Gentlemen sportsmen. Very nice. On the straight into the tight corner at Nouveau Monde, there’s only one line through it. Behra pulls up next to you, challenging. You’re even. But two objects cannot occupy the same point in space at the same moment in time. Behra doesn’t lift. The corner races at you. You have perhaps a crisis of identity:“Am I a sportsman or a competitor?”“How will the French think of me if I run Behra into a tree?”You lift, he passes. He won, you lose! Because at that same moment Behra thought, “Fuck it, we both die.” Make no mistake, all of us are racers-or have been. We all are certain, “It will never happen to me.” Then my friend is killed. I give up racing forever on Monday. I’m back racing by Sunday. We all know it’s our deadly passion. Our terrible joy. But if you get into one of my cars– and no one is forcing you to take that seat– you get in to win. Brake later. Steal their line. Make them make the mistake.I would have taken him. Behra.I’m changing the lineup for the Mille Miglia. I want you and Olivier to swap cars. He’ll drive the little coupe and you’ll take one of the 335’s.You’re giving me one of the most powerful cars in the race.Well, put it another way: I’m giving Olivier the more agile coupe.Won’t he mind?Well, of course he will, but he’ll beat you anyway.This is the power of attorney which Signor Ferrari requested that you put your name on. And the check for $500,000.It has not been signed. The signing of these affidavits was conditional on the exchange of the check.I’m sure it was an oversight.Bullshit, Cosetti. Go away, please. Give me a pen.[sighs][sighs]Excel',\n",

The boy is yours?Yes.I need to think about this.[slams telephone][line buzzing]She found out.The boy?That too.So what do you think?The driver in front will piss his pants when he sees it in his mirror. And when it passes, it has an ass on it like a Canova sculpture. So what do I do?What do you want to do?Leave her.So, do it. You see that pigeon up there? I left its door open, but it won’t come out. It’s forgotten what freedom is.Freedom for that pigeon is pigeon pie.Tell Laura that you two should live apart, you are going to live with Lina, and that you are going to recognize the boy. Everybody thinks that you should anyway.I don’t give a damn what everybody thinks. What do you think?There are a lot of people on your payroll with families. Ferrari needs continuity to stay Ferrari.[sighs] We have history. … Stay there, pigeon, or you’re dead meat.The whole of Emilia knows, but not me?I thought it would break your heart.You broke my heart years ago, Enzo. When did it start?The war. The factory had been bombed twice. Uh, it began during the worst of it. She worked at Carrozzeria Orlandi. You and Dino were in the hills that year, and by Christmas she was pregnant. So I bought Castelvetro and she went to live there.Is she different from the others?I was in love with her. And I still am.[scoffs] I find myself sharing my whole life with a woman I have never met. [chuckles softly] It makes a mockery of you in the years when our son was ill. When he was dying.How can you say that?That boy, is he going to inherit our factory, our name? ‘Cause I don’t want him to. We have a son.One son, two sons. Five sons. I miss Dino any less? Every morning I see him in the cemetery. The hospital he died in is funded in his name. A school was built in his honor!Honor? Who gives a shit? You were supposed to save him!You blame me for his death?Yes! Yes, because you promised me he wouldn’t die!Everything. I did everything. Tables showing what calories he could eat. What went in, what came out. I graphed the degrees of albuminuria, the degrees of azotemia! Diuresis! I know more about nephritis and dystrophy than cars!Yes, I blame you! I blame you ’cause you let him die.The father deluded himself! The great engineer! “I will restore my son to health.” Swiss doctors, Italian doctors. Bullshit. I could not. I did not!‘Cause you were so consoled at Castelvetro, you lost your attention. You had another boy growing stronger while Dino was getting weaker!What goes on in your mind? He got sick. Dystrophy. Kidneys! It destroyed him! It destroyed us.What do you care? Huh? You have another son! You have another wife!She’s not my wife. But he is my son.Move out. These are the papers. They give you power to negotiate on my behalf. And there is a problem with your check. You forgot to put your name on it.We are partners. This is a gun pointed at our head. You cash it before I conclude the deal, Ferrari is no more.That’s right.[door opens][door closes][door opens][door closes][Ferrari] It’s done. She knows. You’ll come to Modena.What?Why not?

I got a message from the bank. You cashed the check.Mm.They’re calling insolvency experts. We’re done.The bank is getting hysterical over nothing.Nothing?You bankrupted us.Enzo, stop it. What good are you doing yourself? Mm, “I’m a scapegoat, I’m a martyr.” Who are you? Who have you become? St. Sebastian? You stand there and let them shoot arrows in your ass? Go beat the hell out of them. The writers. Those cheap hacks. Threaten them. Extort them. And those still on their feet, the most sanctimonious and hypocritical, those, you give them brown envelopes. And then they also will discover that, “Perhaps the Sage of Maranello has been maligned unfairly. Perhaps moderation should reassert itself in the distinguished Italian press.” And for that, you need the cash.[sighs]You thought I’d pack a suitcase and go, right?It crossed my mind.It crossed my mind too.You’re financing this?No, lending it.And the conditions are?No conditions.Oh.No conditions. There was a part of you in Dino. Your warmth. Your wit. Your joy. He had that. I had that from you in our early years. But after a time, I only got what was left when you came home from the fights in the factory. The ambition, the drive, the plots. The paranoia. Even our fucking. As if that could save Dino. What I loved in you I also found in him. All that’s gone. There is no condition. You have the money. [sniffs] But it is my wish… for my grief for our son, for the years building this… you do not acknowledge the boy with the name Ferrari while I am alive.How’d you get here?[Piero] I came with Giuseppe.Giuseppe? Your mother sent him because she wants me to come home. … You haven’t been here before, have you?No.Do you know something?Hmm?Your mother and you are going to come live with me in Modena.Papa. Is the TV reception better?[laughs] Much better.[exhales]You can see the tower from my window.Did you get de Portago’s autograph?I did.[gasps]Come. I’ll introduce you to your brother Dino.

Icarusis a 2017 documentary film that follows the journey of Bryan Fogel, an amateur cyclist who decides to experiment with doping to improve his performance. However, his plan takes an unexpected turn when he meets Grigory Rodchenkov, a Russian scientist who reveals the shocking truth about the state-sponsored doping program in Russia. The film becomes a geopolitical thriller as Fogel and Rodchenkov expose the biggest scandal in sports history, involving dirty urine, unexplained death, and Olympic gold.The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2018.Icarus is streaming onNetflix* * *[bat strikes ball][crowd cheering][announcer] Line drive to right field…[man] Solemnly swear the testimony you’re about to give will be the truth…[Marion Jones] I have never, ever failed a drug test.Before, during and after the Olympics.Over 160 drug tests.I have never failed a test.[woman] For the record, have you ever used human growth hormone or any other performance-enhancing substance?[Lance Armstrong] No.[man] I’m trying to make sure your testimony’s clear.[Armstrong] How many times do I have to say it?I’ve never taken drugs.[man] You’re winning the Tour de France…[Armstrong] How clear is that?[man] …win the Tour de France, like the all-time greats who’ve ever won this big event.[Armstrong] Extraordinary accusations… must be followed up with extraordinary proof.And they have not come up with extraordinary proof.[Bryan Fogel] See…We have… this mountain bike.Loading up the Thule rack.And this is my entire life in the car right now, set up, ready for insanity.I’m getting ready for the single hardest amateur cycling event in the world.It’s basically a miniature Tour de France for insane people.[man] Does it qualify for anything if you do well with it?[Fogel] Yeah, stupidity.[both laughing]I’ve been riding for 28 years seriously, but never as a professional.Going to these massive amateur events that are not professional, but, I mean, there’s serious guys there. And the… [laughs]Max! He loves… He’s got a foot fetish.[man laughs] It tickles![Fogel] I certainly didn’t know when I started on this what it was gonna lead to.When LeMond won that first Tour de France, I was in seventh grade, I think.[man] Can you believe it? After over 2,000 miles…His name in French means “the world,” and this is the world of Greg LeMond in Paris today.[Fogel] Being the first American to win it, it really brought me into the sport.I ate a wheel going about 40 miles an hour.I spent my entire freshman year of college with plastic teeth in my mouth.I would’ve kept racing if it wasn’t for that.[man] He’s really hurting…[Fogel] Later, Armstrong came along. That was a whole other ball of wax.[man] …off the back wheel of Armstrong, they can’t respond to pressure.[man 2] The gap is there.He is just going faster and faster and faster.[man] This has to be the greatest comeback in any sport.The fact that Armstrong managed to conquer cancer was unbelievable.Now he’s riding at the front of the Tour de France like a Trojan.[Fogel] I think I’m a year and a half younger than Lance.He was kind of my hero.[Oprah Winfrey] For now, I’d just like a yes or a no.Did you ever take banned substances to enhance your cycling performance?Yes.[Fogel] I’d always suspected that he had been doping.I felt that I didn’t really wanna know.Because a lot of the guys that he raced with and guys who had raced against him that I’d just known over the years… they were my friends.If you would’ve had your choice, you would’ve never doped?[mutters][Fogel] Ever?Up until it directly affected me, I was like, “I think Lance is probably clean.” [chuckles][Dave Zabriskie] I don’t know.It’s… messy.[Fogel] The way they got him, this is what nobody understood.[Armstrong] 150 times over the last six years, I’ve been tested.In competition, out of competition, at home, at a race, seven in the morning, seven at night, whatever, and they’re all clean.[Fogel] He never failed a drug test.[indistinct chatter][man] Solemnly swear the testimony you’re about to give will be the truth?[Fogel] It was his teammates who had turned on him as part of the federal investigation.[crowd cheering]If this guy had passed, whatever it is, 500 doping tests over his entire career, clearly the system didn’t work.How many times did you test Lance during his career?[Don Catlin] As the laboratory of record, I’m estimating that I would’ve tested him 50 times. 5-0.[Fogel] So you tested Lance 50 times and never caught him?Correct.I developed and operated the UCLA Olympic Laboratory for 25 years.I’m known mostly for developing tests so that athletes get caught if they’re using drugs.[Fogel] How did you personally feel every year?Did you believe that it was just Lance?Do you think that…They’re all doping.Every single one of ’em.Unfortunately, the drugs work. [chuckles]With certain knowledge, you can get around the testing all the time.It’s really easy to beat.Very easy.[Fogel] Originally, the idea that I had was to prove the system in place to test athletes was bullshit.I had read about the hardest amateur cycling race on the planet, this seven-day race through the French Alps, called the Haute Route.If you were to take the hardest seven days in the Tour de France, put ’em all together back-to-back-to-back-to-back, that would be what this Haute Route course was like.The first year I did it totally clean.There were 440 masochists.My goal was to be in the top 100.After seven days, 75,000 feet of climbing and 1,000 miles…I was destroyed.[coughing]But I finished 14th.There’s about ten guys, it seems, that are on just another level than everybody else.Then there’s this next group, and then there’s me.[Fogel on phone] What did you think of the idea?[Catlin] Well, in certain senses, I like the idea.It depends on what you consider to be dangerous…[Fogel] Right.[Catlin] …testing yourself on these drugs.But I was curious, you know, how you were going to do it.I might be willing to help and advise and… avoid positives.[Zabriskie] Are you gonna take drugs?Yeah. Basically, go through… go through an entire doping program, but overseen by the scientist.I’m gonna have Don Catlin design a program for me that’s gonna get through every single one of the doping controls in the world… clean.If I could do that and I could get away with it, that would mean that pretty much any athlete could do that and any athlete could get away with it.[Catlin] You’re going to need a laboratory to test your body fluids.[Fogel] I wasn’t sure how I was gonna get my samples into the lab yet.The only labs that test professional athletes are WADA-accredited labs.[Catlin] WADA is the World Anti-Doping Agency.[Fogel] The labs are set up that you can’t just go do this.Because if somebody could just send their samples into a lab, then anybody could figure out how to game the system.And then…[Catlin] This could da',\n",
       "  'mage my reputation that I’ve worked on for years…[Fogel] He just started getting worried about his legacy.[Catlin] My involvement… it’s just not gonna work.[Fogel] He backed out.But, you know, God bless Don Catlin, because he told me that he knew this guy…[Catlin] The director of the Olympic lab in Moscow, Grigory Rodchenkov.He’s a great old friend.[Fogel] We talk a few times. He’s in Moscow.And that set off this whole chain of events.[ringing][woman speaking indistinctly][Grigory Rodchenkov] Tell something.Hi.Oh! Great.It’s a secret window. Now it’s clean.Hmm.Yeah, you look good now.Yes, you, too. Go ahead.[chuckles]I met with this guy who’s gonna at least, like, prescribe me the protocol.What is your ultimate purpose? You would like to beat doping test?You would like to start your hormonal program?Yes.Then give sample… and prove negative.Yes.Ha, ha, ha.You need a very serious advisor because there are a lot of traps.[toy squeaking]Normally drug… Okay.[speaking Russian][in English] My dog is playing.I just came back, and he’s very much excited.And he has a special toy…[toy squeaking]Yeah, I hear it.Hey, you wanna see my dog?Let me get him.Yes.[chuckles]Oh![Rodchenkov] Is it male, female?Male.Castrated?No. [chuckles][Rodchenkov] So with balls?He’s got the balls.Yeah. There is the balls. Yes, yes.[all laughing]Yeah, this is Max.[Rodchenkov] Max.Max. Yeah.Testosterone, you have to have a prescription.Yes, uh, injectable.Injectable, right.So, now you are clever, huh?Like Lance Armstrong.Send it to me.Names, doses, for how long…So everything should be orchestrated.[Fogel] How do I do that? Just send you everything I’m gonna take?[Rodchenkov] Yes, your one-month schedule. Yes.We’ve got three medications that you’ll take by injection.This is five times a week?Yeah, it’s all on your regimen sheet.We’ll draw up half a cc.Looks like a big needle.It’s a tiny needle.Really?Yeah.Your testosterone comes ready to go. This is very, very viscous.It’s a very thick substance, so you need a big needle to draw it up.Then we’re gonna pull out.So there’s your .2 CC’s.And that one goes also in the top of your thigh.[inhales sharply]I’m a little nervous, but all right.Okay.[Scott Brandt] Give me a thigh.And does it hurt the muscle? Do you flex?[Brandt] It’s not gonna go in your muscle. It’s gonna go above.You just pinch it, and we’re just gonna go just through the skin.That’s it.And then we’re just gonna put that underneath the skin.Did that hurt?[Fogel] No, not too bad.I mean, I see it there.It’ll go away in no time.[Brandt] That’s the HCG.Oh, shit.[Brandt] And right next to it, the testosterone.Pop it through the skin. That’s all we’re looking to do.Just through the skin. It’s real thick now.And you are pumped up.Whoa!How long till those bumps go down?They’ll go quick. Within a half hour.Okay. Whoa.And so we begin.[Brandt] The ability to go day after day will be brand new for you, I think.Going to do an injection.[Fogel] Exciting.[Brandt] I work with one trainer that does a lot of fitness as well as nutrition coaching.[Ben Stone] Almost there. Come on, Bryan.[Brandt] We should be able to see a 15 to 20% improvement.[Fogel] What’s your dog’s name again?[Rodchenkov] Vrangei.Okay. Did you start your program?[Fogel] I did.This is my morning pill-popping routine.And then I prepare the testosterone.[Rodchenkov] Yes, testosterone propionate.[Fogel] Yes.It’s really thick.What made you think that Grigory might help me?Well, it’s difficult for me to answer that without… saying things about Grigory that aren’t very kind.Okay, let me think.So, you’ve already did it for two weeks?[dog pants]He’s fucking me.[Fogel laughing]He’s fucking me. [speaking Russian][in English] Just pee and collect your urine today.And drop into the freezer.So just pee, take some urine and put it in the freezer?In the freezer.There’s day eight, day ten…Needle.The testosterone with the HGH, it’s a weird feeling because it doesn’t feel like I’m on anything.Are you now training? And you feel a little bit stronger?Yeah, I really felt stronger.That’s good.Forty milligrams each other day is a very good protocol.[Fogel] I still had no idea why a WADA lab director who did all the testing for the Sochi Olympics would agree to do this, because his job was supposed to be to catch athletes.So you want me to do 24,000 units in one month?Yes.[Fogel] Fuck, man. That’s a lot of EPO.[Rodchenkov] You have just common fears, and it’s paranoia.We are imitating… We are reproducing Lance Armstrong’s scenario.I’m getting kind of bruises all over my legs.Don’t disturb your thigh at all. Stop it.You can inject into your thigh muscle, but better to the ass.[Fogel stammers] Into my ass?[Rodchenkov] Much more![Fogel] Okay.This is starting to get ridiculous.Ow!Wow! I’m bleeding from that. [inhales sharply] Okay.Oh, fuck, I’m really bleeding from that one, too.Let me get some alcohol.Um, okay, so then a half of this one.[inhales deeply]Oh, fuck![sighs]Um… [grunts]Okay.So, that’s that.He was like, [in Russian accent] “You don’t do subcutaneous. You put it right into your ass.[laughing]No, we go one inch into buttocks. Show me that bottle again.”[Stone] You’re kidding me.[Rodchenkov] Have you seen movie with me?No.Separate movie.Which movie?No?About me.[man] All athletes in Russia are doping.The athletes that are under Mr. Rodchenkov, they don’t get positive tests.[narrator in German] The laboratory was internationally recognized for research.Its head scientist is considered an outstanding scientist.Grigory Rodchenkov.[woman in Russian] Dr. Rodchenkov is informed about everything.He knows how long the drugs need to disappear from the body.He is aware and instructs. He’s the most important specialist.[Fogel] The ARD documentary regarding the Russian whistle-blowers…what did you think, hearing these allegations?It was inflammatory enough that they were afraid to run it while the whistle-blowers were still in Russia.So they got them out of Russia, ran the program, and it was a bombshell.[man] 99% of Russian athletes are guilty of doping.That’s according to a recent German documentary aired on ARD.[woman] WADA’s president, Craig Reedie, promised an investigation, effective immediately.[Craig Reedie] It is wrong just to make any kind of assumption on allegations in the media.Athletes must be presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.These are wild allegations, and we’ll have to check them out.[Richard McLaren] Reedie had to do something.That’s how the Independent Commission was created.I had investigative experience for a decade and a half, and some big investigations, like US Olympic Committees and Major League Baseball.[man] And Bonds hits one high! It’s a ding!Our mandate was athletics, track and field and Russia.The WADA chairman named this Independent Commission and said, “Let’s get at it.”[man] The Anti-Doping Agency wants a report by the end of the year, and athletics officials say they’ll cooperate.It’s unclear, though, what actions might be taken.Thomas Daigle, CBC News.[Fogel] Is it gonna be okay? Is it gonna pass over?Is this gonna cause you…No, no, no. It’s growing.It’s growing?It’s like a tornado coming.Okay, so you are receiving how many units?[Fogel] Grigory, the Moscow scientist I was showing you, who did all the testing for Sochi, who’s now at the center of this big Russian doping scandal.Russia was doping their athletes in the ’80s.Apparently, they’ve never stopped.Really?[Fogel] The crazy thing is, Richard Pound, the guy who was the head of WADA for 15 years, has actually been hired to lead the investigation against Grigory.Um… I don’t know what you want me to do with that.Meaning?I don’t know how… Shit. My computer’s about to die.I don’t know how…Let me grab my power cord. I’ll be back.Do you have a charger? All right.There might be someone else out there that might be a better decision or choice.You’re using this guy ',\n",
       "  'as your coach. What’s your comfort level?Here’s how I’m looking at it…You can find someone else.I guess you call it “doping doctors.” I don’t know what you would label Grigory.Is he a biochemist? I don’t even know.It doesn’t even matter. I don’t like this shit.[Fogel] Look, there’s no finding someone else.[Brandt] Your numbers look great.Your testosterone is pretty much right where we want you.Grigory, what’s the typical wash-out for urine to go to negative from a full treatment of testosterone?How many days does that take usually? Seven?[Rodchenkov] For Bryan, two weeks will be nice.Is there any way that we could test that here in the States, or it’s gotta go back to you to test those frozen urines?It’s the only way. But again, I am under heavy control.WADA now, they have an inquiry about me.[Brandt] Yes.So you see, like, me… I’m a very dangerous person.How do you think is the best way to basically get that test done?Maybe, hopefully…I would like to do this, to come to, maybe, LA, and to smuggle something to Russia. Some urines from you.Um… [stammers]Could we send ’em to Salt Lake City or another lab?No, no, no. It’s strictly prohibited.[indistinct chatter]You are so skinny! [speaking Russian]You’re skinny.No![Fogel] All the urine in my freezer, we have to unfreeze it?[Rodchenkov] Yes, we unfreeze, then we homogenize to make sure everything is melted.I took special bottles for smuggling urine, and… we will make a scenario like I am collecting my urine.“Grigory one, morning.”“Evening, 28th. Grigory two.”Then we recode them.Perfect.Otherwise, what is the source of the urine and why?Right.The goal during this two-to three-week period is to push you to an extreme on a chronic level, not just acute.Okay, we…[Fogel] Max!He loves me.[Fogel] Yeah. Max…No, no, don’t kick Max. It’s okay.Max, go away. Out.No, no, no.It’s not good time.[laughing]Later.[Stone] A fifteen-second acceleration whenever you want. Good.We need girls, cheerleaders.[Stone] Right? Exactly. Maybe we should get you some pom-poms.And like this…Right.[Rodchenkov] I was working here in 1989, when Catlin was in big power.Laboratory was located in UCLA. The campus.[Catlin] Twenty years ago, we had decided to develop a way to get actually friendly with what was then the Soviets.We, the US, would invite Soviets to come to the US and pick and choose athletes that they wanted to test, bring ’em in and test them where the Soviets were watching.Grigory was the first representative.He shows up at the second day of work in bright orange shorts and announces that he’s gonna enter the Santa Monica Marathon.And he won the darn thing.He’s a good athlete.[Rodchenkov] I was almost a professional in running.1,500 meters and five kilometers at Moscow University.My mother always pushed me to swim, to ski.I realized that some people are using something.Last year, he was nobody. Next year, he has muscles.Of course, I also started to use the best of the best, stanozolol.And all injections were done by my mother.And, of course, it was 50 milligrams, this simple thing.[Fogel] Wait, wait. Your mother injected you?Yes, of course.But if you are not national team level, like Olympic, you cannot afford any more training camp.So, I graduated to Moscow University, to the chemical department.I liked doping control. I liked sports.And since 1985, I worked in the top field of laboratories in the world.And then, Moscow laboratory was doing mistake by mistake.“We need a new director, and it will be upheld by WADA.”That’s how I became director.[Fogel] Should I be taking the HGH and the testosterone now?[Rodchenkov] Let’s look at your protocol.I have to sketch all schematics, starting from the new year.We’ll sit down with a piece of paper.Yes.With the piss and then with the tubes.We take just a fraction.And then it will be coded and took for analysis.So, here’s day one. Okay? Here’s day two.Here’s day three, day four, day five.[Rodchenkov] Seven, eight, nine.We have nine urines. Okay.So we are starting…[Fogel] And that one, I just took.Is that enough? Or do I need any more?It’s okay.[Fogel] Okay.Three, three, three.I hear you got the real code.I am mafia.This is mafia.[laughing]Chased by WADA.Could you imagine, the best laboratory will be puzzled with your piss?In Russia, the empire of evil.Propaganda.[mutters]Fantastic.Oh, God. What is that?It’s flakes. Your flakes.What is that? What is that?Your sins. [clicks tongue]And on the top.[Fogel] When I come to Moscow in September, after the race, I can drink.Okay, next time. Next time, if I survive.At my lab, WADA is keeping laboratory on a very short leash. Leash?Asking many questions.All sort of bullshit.Like, “Where is your… underground laboratory for pre-testing? Where is the shadow laboratory?”Of course, my laboratory is fully under… cameras and everything, computers, barcodes…But they were looking for something.Like a secret lab?Yes, yes, yes, yes, underground.Batman?Yes, yes.Who owns the lab?The state.The state does?Yes.Okay, we have Terminal One, departing flight.[Fogel] Yeah.♪ I am a woman in love ♪[grunts]Keep it. It’s my donation.No, no, no!No, no, no.I have a lot, you see.All people are presenting me with pens, so I have full collection.Remember me.I will.So I’m gonna see you…So, so, so nice with you.Grigory, thanks for coming.Yes.Be very careful with what you are recording.It’s not permitted. It’s like pornography and erotics.Sports pornography and erotics.Now we are…[laughing]And I see you, uh, in September.[Rodchenkov] Yes, definitely.[Fogel] Did you go to Moscow?No, I did not, and Dick Pound did not.We wanted to send an investigative group of WADA specialists into the Moscow lab.The director of the lab, he was the last fail-safe position, right?If there is a sample that’s potentially positive, where can you stop it from being reported?In the lab.So he was interviewed. Didn’t provide us with much information.Icarus 2017 movie poster[Fogel] Please tell me all my frozen piss didn’t explode in your bag.[Rodchenkov laughs]But this is big secret.Bryan, I have all urines.We analyzed urines for your steroid profile.Everything is kept frozen.I have a full agenda, so don’t worry.Okay.[Rodchenkov] We did preliminary tests, but not much.When WADA will leave…They are leaving tomorrow night.Then maybe Friday, or maybe Monday, anyway…[Fogel] WADA’s there bothering you?[Rodchenkov] It’s much more challenging.WADA is sniffing and asking tons of questions.Dick Pound… You know, Dick Pound?YesHe’s starting to understand it’s very difficult to prove something.What do you see the outcome or the solution as?We will see.You just focus on racing.Keep digging, keep digging. Keep digging, come on.Come on, you got it. Come on. Four, two, one.Taking it down. Taking it down.This is already better than last time.Last year, 250 watts. This year, 349. It’s 100 watts.[Fogel] My power right now is 20% more than I had last year.Yes, yes, finally you have some gains. Some gain, some progression.I can’t wait to come to Moscow.Bryan, it will be fantastic.[Fogel] I shouldn’t bring any EPO with me to Europe, right?[Rodchenkov] No.[Fogel] Okay.[Rodchenkov] You complete everything until 17th.The last injection is on US soil.Okay.[Rodchenkov] Before passing the border and the customs.Then you’re taking urine with you to me, and we’ll complete your biological passport.That’s it.[woman] Words cannot describe what you’ll be living through this week.Your body’s gonna shut down. It’s gonna break down entirely.[man] We are on the French Cycling Federation calendar, and we do have an anti-doping policy.[Fogel] As far as testing for PEDs, the race says that they do.They may come and test, just so you’re aware.[Fogel] As I came to learn, they don’t.[Rodchenkov] Don’t worry.[Fogel] But I had Grigory.He had helped me dope, and he was gonna test my samples through his WADA lab in Moscow.[Rodchenkov] So, be clever.I ha',\n",
       "  've not done a urine sample since I’ve been here.You are like a pioneer.[Fogel] So I’m gonna pee in this little bag here.[Rodchenkov] You are a victim of your ideas.August 21st.See you at the end. And good luck tomorrow.[announcer] Start time tomorrow morning, 7:15.[Fogel] Right here.[Rodchenkov] I am like a priest.I am healing your doping paranoia.You are free. You have enough power, and God is with you.You are sentenced to win.[Fogel] So the scheme was now in place.[announcer] Raise your arms!Are you ready?Start!Ninety, ninety. That’s it.[announcer] Pouly![crowd cheering][indistinct shouting][Stone] You did great.You were three and a half minutes behind Pouly.[Fogel] That’s not bad.No, that’s fucking great.You guys were hauling ass.Bryan’s in that group data. He’s in there with the top ten guys.[Fogel] All the guys in the top ten are incredible.[Rodchenkov] Very good.[Fogel] They could be pro.[Rodchenkov] You are a monster. [laughs]Medium-sized monster.[Stone] Bryan Fogel, can you hear me?Can’t raise him on the walkie-talkie. Bryan, come back.[Stone] Bryan!Yeah?[Stone speaking indistinctly][Stone] It has to be charged.The battery’s dead. It needed to be charged.Now it won’t go up. You see? Dead. It’s totally dead.[Fogel] Fuck![Fogel] My derailleur, my shifting, it broke.[Rodchenkov] Your bike?Yes.[Rodchenkov] You cannot shift your gears?[Fogel] For 100 kilometers.[Rodchenkov] My goodness.I dropped ten places in the rankings.Okay. Hmm.My God.[Fogel] I feel that I’m really stronger this year.Like, that I’m recovering.[Brandt] Yeah.[Fogel] I mean, I’m hauling ass, but they’re…I’m not beating ’em. They’re in a different…There’s guys that I don’t know that you could’ve beat on your best day.[Fogel] My whole plan was to have a substantially better performance this year.And…I’m not.[Stone] Did you just get separated or what?Neutral descent now?[man] Does it hurt that you did better last year than you did this year?I mean, I could have been 21 years old and taken all the blood bags and EPO in the world, and I was still not going to be a Tour de France champion.It doesn’t matter.[Rodchenkov] Just stay optimistic.Because now, we can change nothing.[announcer] The winner, Peter Pouly.[crowd applauds][Fogel] I felt pretty good. I just had…[Rodchenkov] No, no, no.[Fogel] I’ve just had some bad luck days.[Rodchenkov] Bryan, look at me.Stop it.You are what you are. I am what I am.It’s a turning point, what we are doing.You should be happy that we have such fantastic material.We have ten times more information than Dick Pound and Armstrong together.[Fogel] Really?We will continue. Don’t worry.You are just like in the reception. You did not enter the first floor.Then there is a second and so on.[Fogel] What’s on the second floor?[Rodchenkov] When you go to Moscow, you will see.[Fogel] So cool.How many tests… I’ve probably had 15 or 20 blood tests.[Rodchenkov] It’s more than enough.Okay.[Fogel] Is this the laboratory?Yes.Oh, you see, this is bloody RUSADA.Bringing samples, it’s not too good to show our camera to them.[Fogel] Oh. You want us to hide?Yes, yes, yes.[Fogel] Okay.Be very careful with all your material.People are very sensitive also, you know.[Fogel] Yes.This is my director place.It’s the most famous laboratory in the world.We cannot say explicitly that you have been analyzed.It’s coming. I already solved everything yesterday.You will have it until, let’s say… Within two weeks, we will do this.But it should be done still, say, under the table, not…[Fogel] Okay.Okay. [clears throat][Rodchenkov] Smile. Your race is over. We have to go downstairs.[Fogel] Are there scientists, or those working in WADA laboratories today, that you suspect could have been corrupted?[Rodchenkov] Each director of laboratory, like me…I have to sign a code of ethics, that what we are doing is not harmful or detrimental to the whole anti-doping society.We go down this emergency exit.[Fogel] What did Russia have to do with the hiding blood passports of all the athletes?[Rodchenkov] Let’s talk in my office.If you hide fight against doping, you cannot be 50% honest.You have to be honest, or you have to hide the ends.It’s the same asOrwell,1984.WADA is like a religion, and you cannot escape.You have to think about money, but you cannot steal money.You have to think about women, but you have to be married and don’t go to prostitution.But again… almost everybody has some period when they were sinners.So what to do?There is no answer.[Fogel] For the last five months, I took urine and then I did blood…[Rodchenkov] Yes, we have a good database.How do we go about the analysis? What do we wanna show?How do we put togetherthe bigger story arc?Bryan, be optimistic.[chuckles]Smile.I have vodka for you.You do?Yes.The best vodka.What kind?From Mordovia.Oh, awesome!You do drink vodka?Yeah, I like vodka.You like… I have vodka for you.I’ve decided I’m not gonna leave Russia. I’m gonna stay here.You would like to stay?Russia is the most relaxing country in the world.You think?No.[both laughing][Fogel] You having fun?Yes, we have fun!Smile.[speaking Russian]Bryan![singing in Russian][indistinct chatter][man] Ladies and gentlemen, members of the media, welcome to Geneva.Almost a year ago, very serious doping allegations were first raised on German television channel ARD.The WADA president, Sir Craig Reedie,announced that a full and thorough inquiry would be conducted.The founding president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Mr. Dick Pound, the chair of that commission.Overwhelming portions of the allegations made on the ARD program have been found by the Independent Commission to be true.It’s worse than we thought. We have found cover-ups.We found destruction of samples in the laboratories.We found payments of money in order to conceal doping tests… among others.Our conclusion was that all of this could not have happened, and continue to happen, without the knowledge of and either actual or implied consent of the state authorities.[Fogel] You reading this?Forty pages of this report is Grigory.It’s hard to imaginewhat the Russian state interest in athletes’ urine would be.One of our big concerns about tests were the 1,400 that were destroyed by the director of the Moscow laboratory.In fact, our recommendation is the director of the laboratory be removed from his position, that the WADA accreditation be withdrawn, and the Russian Federation be suspended.[line ringing][Veronika] Bryan, hi.[Fogel] Hi.Where did Grigory go?I’ve been crying.Yes, I am with him, and I think maybe you want to speak with him.Maybe he’s a little bit nervous.I’m so sorry.[Rodchenkov] Bryan.I’m not… I’m sorry. I’m trying to understand what you’re saying.[Rodchenkov] I’m absolutely saying that we will overturn all this bullshit, and it will be upside down.So, Bryan, I hardly could talk to you tonight.[line disconnects][woman] The details are damning and could have a profound impact on the future of Russian athletics.[man] This WADA commission has accused Russian athletics of state-sponsored doping.[in Russian] We are preparing our response to again provide any explanation needed.That’s all I can say at this point.Does this mean they could potentially miss next year’s Olympics?Well, that is certainly one of the potential outcomes here.[man] The International Olympic Committee have released a statement.You will see athletes being sanctioned by the IAAF.You will see athletes and officials being excluded.And you will see an action led by the IOC.We’ll apply this zero-tolerance policy.[man] Decision time for the IAAF on whether Russia’s track and field athletes will be allowed to compete at the Rio Olympics.I want to hear what the Athletics Federation of Russia is actually saying in answer to those allegations.[man] The Sports Minister, Vitaly Mutko, has said, “Russia took all the necessary measures,” he says, “to fight the doping proble',\n",
       "  'm.Moscow’s anti-doping lab was recently recognized as one of the best in the world.”You don’t want to talk to us?Well, the employees at this lab are clearly being very tight-lipped, but the report from the World Anti-Doping Agency goes into great detail describing the alleged activities inside that building.[Rodchenkov] There are around 50 correspondents behind my fence, but I am here.And I am not supposed to talk.Bryan, stay quiet.You’re a lucky man. Only you, knowing me.[Skype call ends]Holy shit.The World Anti-Doping Agency suspended Russia’s sports drug-testing lab, and the head of the lab resigned.[Veronika in Russian] Grisha, be careful what you tell him now.[Rodchenkov] Don’t tell me. I am just…[Veronika] They’re holding on the phone for you.[Rodchenkov] Tell them I’ll call back…[Veronika] It sounds serious.[Rodchenkov] I’ll call back in five minutes![Veronika] Okay, but will you?[Rodchenkov] Yes, go away![Veronika] Fine.[Rodchenkov] Bryan…[in English] It’s a disaster.They’re just killing people.Cutting heads, you know, without who is guilty.Yesterday, you know, I went to Minister Mutko, and we started to discuss.He was talking, blah, blah, blah, about football.Uh, blah, blah, blah, about Formula 1.Then to say what to do with bloody doping.But he say, “Could you resign?” I go, “Yes.”“Today?” “Yes, today.”And I resigned.And… they lost director.I have a lot of calls, but I’m just changing my telephones.People are looking for their job, but laboratory is almost empty.Empty.I don’t know what’s going on.I just know what I’m reading in the newspaper and in the press and…You know.Oh, really? Really?I mean, will they come after you?Are they gonna arrest you? Are they gonna…Would they try to put you in jail?In jail? No.What is the reason for jail?You know.No.Are you in any danger?Yes, but not jail. It could be some… I don’t know.I mean…Do you know that I am now moving with a security man?Security guard.No.Just a security guard in my home.In your home?Coming to my car.I’m following behind.It’s recommended until the end of the week, because I am the only man who can kill both sides.Russia and WADA, so…Stay quiet.[Vitaly Mutko in Russian] Let me say this.In reality, the Independent Commission’s report and statements made by Mr. Pound are exaggerated.We’ve even built a modern, state-of-the-art anti-doping laboratory that is renowned for its testing for the Olympics, Paralympics, championships and more, and received the highest merits for its contributions.The government is merely financing the laboratory operation.[Rodchenkov in English] They don’t accept this Independent Commission at all.They’re deliberately lying.Bryan, Bryan… look at me.[Fogel] Okay.[Rodchenkov] It means I could be tossed under the bus anytime.I’m not sure that we are connecting freely.Because now we are on radar, that’s for sure.You knowSnowden?Yeah, of course.Now you see. [clicks tongue]We still don’t know… We still don’t know whether Russia is participating in Olympic Games or not.The outcome, why I am very much cautious about my life…If me will be purged…okay, Russia will go to the Olympics.[clicking tongue] The problem is to survive.Listen, I, uh…Yes.Joking, you know, seriousness aside…Stop it. Stop, stop.I’m just… I’m worried about you.Yes, yes.Tomorrow, I drop you.And then, when I say… [clicks tongue]“How is weather in Los Angeles?” or anything related to weather… it means that we will talk in 15, 20 minutes.Be ready to talk.[Sebastian Coe] Tonight, our sport finds itself in a shameful situation.And that is why I can confirm the council has overwhelmingly voted, with immediate effect, to suspend the Russian Federation.It’s done so, uh, by 22 votes to one.It is the strongest sanction… [continues indistinctly][in Russian] Regarding the recent events connected to our track and field team, I urge the sports minister and all my sports colleagues to make this their number one priority.This is the first step.Secondly, it is vital to conduct our own internal investigation.[clears throat] Sport should be fair.Responsibility should be personalized and absolute.[Rodchenkov] Bryan…I need… Wait, look at me.Yeah.I need to escape and to walk… to walk…You can go wherever you want.Okay.I will be doggy-sitting at your home.So you wanna get out?Yes. Simply.What do you want to, uh…It’s very suspicious when you have one-way ticket, you know.Yeah, right. You have to book a round trip.[Veronika in Russian] They’re watching us.[Rodchenkov] Bryan?Yeah.[Rodchenkov] What I am doing, myself, I can do nothing.So…Okay?[stammering]I’ll send you… Let me figure out some flight options, okay?Okay.[Fogel] I’m gonna get the flight, right now.[Rodchenkov] Yes, right now.Okay.[Rodchenkov] Go.Also, some security measures will be set.[Fogel] How will I know that you made it through okay?[Rodchenkov] Um…I don’t know.Okay?Okay.[both] Okay.[Rodchenkov] Bryan?Yeah, I’m right here.Okay, just left my security man.[Fogel] Okay.[Rodchenkov] I am very much dizzy, paranoid.[Fogel] We’ll get you here.[Rodchenkov] My wife and children decided maybe it’s better to stay in Russia.[Fogel] Just gotta make sure in the US that you’re okay also.[Rodchenkov] My daughter…[Fogel] Yes?[Rodchenkov] She’s getting married.[Fogel] Right.[Rodchenkov] Married, everything.It’s time.[Fogel] Okay.[Rodchenkov] Cross fingers now.[Fogel] You, too.[Rodchenkov] RememberOrwell.“We will meet each other where there is no darkness.”[Fogel] When I first interviewed you a year ago, I asked you if you thought your investigation would be a defining moment in the history of sport.How would you answer that question now?Yes, it can be a defining moment, and I think it should.You’ve got your number one Olympic sport in the crosshairs, and you’ve got one of the major Olympic countries in the world in the crosshairs, even if it’s the crosshairs only on athletics at the moment.That has the potential of affecting the credibility of all sport and, therefore, the continued viability of all sport.Why would I watch an event that’s fixed?[indistinct announcement over PA][Fogel] There he is.I’m here, yes!He’s escaped.This is… Yes. Escaped alive.[chuckles]Come on.[laughing][Fogel] Then you did what?[Rodchenkov] Destroyed my computer from my working place.I took hard disk. And also, I have three copies.It’s a historical moment.[Dan Cogan on phone] Grigory, I want you to know that I understand your desire to be visible and I think that’s very important for you, to be safe.I was on the phone yesterday with the lawyer forEdward Snowden.They have some recommendations.I have everything with me, and also I destroyed my office computer.Put it in a very safe place and dropped there like a dummy.[Cogan] We’ll talk in a few hours.[Fogel] This is, uh… This is it.[Rodchenkov] Uh-huh.It’s like a labyrinth.[Fogel] Yeah.Okay, this is the place.[Rodchenkov] Good.Here’s, um… bed, bathroom.[Rodchenkov] Secure place.It’s a good thing.[Fogel] This’ll work, at least till we get what the plan is and what we’re gonna do.[Rodchenkov] He goes to me. He remembers me since May.You will be learning Russian.You will be learning Russian very soon.I’m missing dogs.There was one thing that I noticed in the IC report, and that was that there were KGB people hanging around the lab.And that’s a real no-no.You know, KGB people are not nice people.So I am at home.[interpreter] We will banish all those who have a suspicious reputation from the leadership of Russian athletics.In 60 days, we will present the renewed athletics with new people…[Fogel] So, if the KGB… I guess they’re called the FSB now…they’re in the lab, who else could finance them but Vitaly Mutko?Oh, I don’t think Vitaly Mutko finances the FSB.That’s a state security operation.But… but Putin?Well, whoever finances it and runs the state security apparatus, it’s not the sport minister.[man] Officials are essentially saying, “There may be some pro',\n",
       "  'blems, but we are trying and have already taken steps to address those problems.”And all of the officials are essentially rejecting the idea that there’s still a major problem.[in Russian] Honey, hi.I am here, far away and in the darkness.You see them all?Wearing fancy suits, ties, making speeches on TV…It’s all a farce.[in English] Of course I was very disappointed when laboratory was closed.Now reading this IC report, I am just watching with another’s eyes.I know that I could change the past, telling the truth.But would you like telling the truth, you will be annihilated.George Orwell, I was reading the first in 1989.I was 30.Before that time, in Soviet Union, the book1984, it was strictly, strictly prohibited.For me, it was totally shocking.Especially “ignorance is strength.”This is the most powerful thing.It was my weapon.It gave me definitions, it gave me coordinates how you can apply to your life.It’s like a road map.” ‘There are three stages in your reintegration,’ said O’Brien. ‘There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It’s time for you to enter upon the first stage.’ “I was thinking that we’d start…I ask you questions, and you answer “yes” or “no.”Does Russia have a systematic, statewide doping system in place to cheat the Olympics?Yes.Were you the mastermind of a statewide system that cheated the Olympics?Of course. Yes.Russia won a total of 73 medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.How many of those athletes were dirty?Thirty.Russia won 81 total medals in London. How many of those were dirty?Oh, even more.50% is for sure. Let it be 50%.They were earned using special program.State-sponsored, of course.Was Putin aware of the existence of a Russian doping system?Yes. Aware of my name.He took me from the prison for such special affair.From prison?Yes.To redeem.Okay, let’s back up one sec here.My concern is that it’s something they would use to discredit you.Oh, of course.So, the first criminal investigation against you, when was it and what happened?Oh, it’s not easy to say how it happened.Before 2008, China was the biggest producer of anabolics.It was produced in a pharmaceutical, well-equipped, good manufacturing practice.No contamination, high qualities.And all these anabolics are coming to Europe, to the United States.It’s the same like in Russia.Of course, at that time in Russia, as the head of laboratory, I was a part of system.There are three or four top-level witch doctors, like Portugalov.Portugalov was the famous anabolic coach of Russian national team.It was Soviet time. He was before me.Portugalov is conveyor of athletes.He has his own protocols, and he really had great success.And then they became Olympic champions.The problem began in 2008.Jacques Rogge, the president of the Olympics, told government of China, “You are Olympic country, but you are producing anabolics in bulk. You cannot do like this anymore. Stop it.”They stop it. Officially.But who is supplying steroids to national team?Before, there was not any concern.You buy stanozolol, it’s stanozolol.But Portugalov was so confident, offering and providing things which were not proven or tested.They have impurities which could be detectable.“Oh,” Portugalov say. “What to do? I spent so much money for this.Maybe you could advise to do?”What advice? Drop it to the trash.Now, in Moscow laboratory, we had the best sensitivity and detection limits.I’m very proud that I created the test for long term metabolites, which caused the detection window to enlarge from two or three weeks to six months.That’s why Portugalov suddenly had so many positives.All people on the national team, they came to ask where to get these steroids.I knew one source.Suddenly, I was coordinating the whole steroid program.[Fogel] So you were cutting out Portugalov?[Rodchenkov] Yes, but what I was doing, I was saving national team from purchasing dirty steroids.Eventually, I don’t know whether it was by purpose, I fight with Portugalov.Then I became enemy.Criminal narcotic police came to my home, they took my computer, and they said, “Then we arrest you on Monday.”I was in such depression and my will was paralyzed.And I decided to escape, I don’t know how.I took some knife from… very, very sharp… from my wife’s kitchen.I drank whiskey, I sit to the bath.And…And… it was…It goes so smooth.Then, in the water, I see how blood is doing like this.It wasn’t very strong, the lock.My wife opened door.[siren wailing]My heart was seared.It was very good surgeon.And since I was considered to be suicide… I was sent to a psychiatric clinic.After seeing that I am depressed, they started to give me such crazy drugs.I was totally out of reality.And then again, something happened.The criminal police, they sentence me to another psychiatric clinic… which is for those who are sadist, who are totally worst-of-the-worst criminals.They respected me very much. [chuckles] I was called “professor.”But I get better, better, better.The most funny thing, they allowed me to use computer, so I was working in psychiatric clinic like a head of laboratory director, advising the whole Russian national team.That time, I received, from Olympic Committee, an invitation to London, 2012 Olympic Games, being the director.Russian ministry was little bit uncertain that I’m criminal in full.But WADA said,“If not Rodchenkov, we don’t see in Russia any other candidate than him. If you don’t send him to London, we send to London another director.”You can imagine how important information from London laboratory is for national team.I had information, what testing this London laboratory is doing, to understand where we are and how much is danger.Without this, all Russian doping situation will be collapsed.Thanks to God, Mutko understood this.I received a call from the Moscow investigators.“Grigory… your case is dropped.”Who took care of it? Who got the charges dropped?Putin. Of course.It’s my redemption. Success in Sochi instead of being in prison.[in Russian] We are two workers, Kamaev and Rodchenkov, with a mission in mind…This is not a mission. This is a revolution.This is an anti-WADA strategy.Of course! Of course![woman] The former head of Russia’s anti-doping agency RUSADA has unexpectedly died.Nikita Kamaev’s death comes just two months after he resigned his post, which is, obviously, following the doping scandal that has rocked Russia and the rest of the world in athletics.[sighs]No, no, no.No, no, no.I have to see.[man] We’re told by RUSADA, which is the doping agency he was formerly the head of, that he appears to have had a massive heart attack.[Rodchenkov] Of course.Bryan?I’m here.You know, my friend?My friend… died.I show you.[man] He’s got no previous history of heart problems.[Rodchenkov speaking Russian]It means, “Grigory, Nikita died.”[man] He just died. And so, it’s an enormous shock.[Rodchenkov] He’s my friend since school time, and he never complained about his heart or any health problem, and…He had a young wife.They dreamed about children. I was talking to him day before.This is…Still, I cannot understand.It cannot be like this.He wrote book.It’s dangerous to write book in Russia.[Fogel] I don’t know. We gotta figure this out, because…Of course, of course.Do you think that they would…Bryan, we are playing the most danger game in the history of sport.WADA, ready to pay everything for me and for you to disappear.Because we destroy not only their future, we destroy their past.You know, there is very bad man still not mentioned.Deputy Minister Mutko.He could kill everybody.He’s a KGB man.He’s very dangerous. He has no moral at all. No, no.“Oh, Nikita is writing book? Fifty-two. Oh, he’s tired. He’s desperate. Oh, please, prepare obituary for the next week.”Can you imagine? I can imagine easily.We should be very much careful.[Fogel] Who were you reporting to?Yuri Nagornykh, vice minister.He was practically invo',\n",
       "  'lved in everyday routine.[Fogel] So you would report to Yuri?[Rodchenkov] Yes.[Fogel] Yuri would report to Mutko?[Rodchenkov] Yes.[Fogel] And Mutko reported to Putin?[Rodchenkov] To Putin, yes.[Rodchenkov] You know, there is no rest if you are paranoid.[Fogel] It was around 12:30, one o’clock at night?[Rodchenkov] Or two. I don’t know.They were just hanging around, so…[Fogel] Somebody in the courtyard?[Rodchenkov] Yes.Two strong men knocked my door and appeared from darkness.They asked me to let them in, and they came here.And we were talking about sport, about many relevant or auxiliary things.They knew about death of Nikita Kamaev.About, first of all, my boss, Minister Mutko.It was inspection and… [mutters]Exhausts my nerves…They finally gave me subpoena.United States district court.You see, it’s for me. “To Grigory Rodchenkov.”[Fogel] You’re commanded to appear in front of the grand jury.[Ed Stier] He had been approached by two FBI agents.They want him to go to New York and appear in a grand jury and provide his information.It triggered a whole series of decisions that had to be made.I’ve checked out these two guys, and both of these guys are not your everyday agent.[Cogan] But why did they come to him?They want him for something else that they’re doing.They didn’t come to him for himself.They’re trying to make a case, and they found out he was in LA.His boss, Mutko, was actually the guy.[lawyer] How was he able to survive?Because he’s Putin’s best friend. He’s the head of the sports ministry.Just what sort of, uh… crime… like, example, I could be done against or under US legislature?The United States Justice Department loves to charge broad conspiracies.That’s their favorite charging instrument.That you conspired with Mutko and others to…What is the conspiracy? It was conspiracy since 1980.Let’s reconsider Moscow Olympic Games, and then reconsider situation in United States in 1984.[lawyer] That’s right.They’re looking for him to plea to what’s called a cooperation agreement.What happens is, he cooperates, and at the end of the day, the judge generally wouldn’t incarcerate him, most likely.[Stier] First of all, we don’t know whether that’s… what the bureau’s interested in at this point.[lawyer] If we turn down, they could indict him.[Fogel] You gotta be shitting me.We can talk to these guys.[Stier] The most important thing is he is not sent back to Russia, where he would certainly be assassinated.[Fogel] We’ve been discussing with Grigory whether or not he should go public in some way prior to the Olympics.[Stier] Prior to the Olympics. What you’re saying is if he’s established as a cooperating witness, he may not be able to do that.[lawyer] That’s right. That’s right. Which is a downside.[Stier] But once Grigory’s public, I think he’s in much less danger.Because if the Russians do anything to hurt him, it makes them look very guilty.[lawyer] Except they’ll just say he had a heart attack, like they did…[Fogel] Grigory, look at me.Is it in your best interest to break the story?Uh…You mean to disclose? We have to disclose.[automated voice] Please enter your participant ID. Thank you.[Rodchenkov] I strongly suggest they stay only with list of 36 athletes.[Fogel] Okay. But they’re about to publish.They’re asking us how they can verify the authenticity of the Sochi list.[Rodchenkov] Yes, this is most important. It’s authentic document.It was in Sochi on my table.And if you go behind this list, there is creation date.[Fogel] And this list came from the ministry?[Rodchenkov] Of course, of course.[Fogel] So, Rebecca, you have the file.So under properties of the file, you can see it was created Tuesday, January 21st, from the ministry.[Fogel] Oh, my God! You’re unrecognizable!Not recognizable at all.Psychological, looking in mirror, it’s not me.The New York Times is breaking tomorrow.Tomorrow?Tomorrow.Oh, I need… I need… [sighs]Intravenous injections to relax. Tomorrow?Tomorrow.[Rodchenkov] Why not?Okay, so here’s what’s happening.[Fogel] Have you spoke to the Department of Justice yet?[lawyer on phone] I told them, and they reacted like I expected they would.They’re upset.Right.So…They wanted to know, did he provide any documents to them?[Fogel] He provided lists of doped athletes.He provided an FSB file of how the testing was arranged at Sochi.Yeah, unfortunately, they’re gonna terminate the whole…Now that he turned over documents, they’re gonna cancel.And they’re just gonna prosecute him.[Rodchenkov] “It’s time for you to enter upon the second stage.”[Jacques Rogge] The International Olympic Committee has the honor of announcing that the 22nd Olympic Winter Games in 2014 are awarded to the city of Sochi.[cheering]That’s future for everything. That’s future for my country! For Russia!Millions of citizens of Russia are united by the Olympic dream.Our national pledge to you is, the choice of Sochi is the best choice.[Rodchenkov] There is a top-level decision.You know who I mean.And big boss, Vladimir Putin, saying, “We have to show the best result in Sochi. We must show the others who we are.”[man] Hurrah![crowd] Hurrah!Hurrah![Rodchenkov] We could make team clean before Sochi. One month.[crowd cheering]But it was decided to use PEDs during Sochi.Through the competition so they could be at their very top level?Right, right.[announcer] Vladimir Putin.[announcer speaking French][Fogel] So instead of using the science, the science that you developed to get around the system, you abandoned the science?Yes.The most important “yes.” Forget about this.Ladies and gentlemen, let me declare the 126th session of the International Olympic Committee open.Thank you.[audience applauding][Rodchenkov] Opening ceremony was the most heartbreaking day… in sports history.Hi, Bryan.The story just broke.[stammering] What do you mean? Is it published or not?Yes, published.[gasps]Published! The story is published![man on TV] According toThe New York Times, Rodchenkov…Okay.This is the photo of bottles.Those bottles were given from Nikita Kamaev.“Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Olympians, said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes, helping to facilitate one of the most elaborate and successful doping ploys in sport history.”[sighs deeply][Thomas Bach] Join and support our fight for fair play.The athletes deserve it.And to you, my fellow Olympic athletes, I say, respect the rules, play fair, be clean.[crowd cheering][Fogel] In 2014, in Sochi, did Russia swap out dirty urine for clean urine?Always.[dramatic music playing][narrator] The information contained in this little bottle helps keep sport on the level playing field.That’s why we created ADAMS, the free Anti-Doping Administration and Management System from WADA.All operating under a level of security typically used by financial institutions.In effect, becoming the centralized clearing house for all anti-doping information.ADAMS. Everyone should play true.[Fogel] Walk us through the collection process.[Dick Pound] The sample is provided in front of a doping control officer.It’s in this container. It’s divided into two.[Fogel] The A sample and the B sample. These are the…[Catlin] Bottles.[Fogel] They’re called the Bereg-Kits?Yes. It’s one particular company in Switzerland that makes them.[McLaren] It’s called the Berlinger bottle, and the Berlinger bottle is state of the art.It’s sealed very tight with a vice-like device.A collector is right there, watching.And then it goes to the lab.It’s in the lab that the B bottles are pulled aside and put in the freezer.The analytical work is done on the A sample.[Olivier Rabin] The way we collect the sample, the trustability of the sample, the fact that we’ve got an A and a B sample is a very, very, uh, safe system.[McLaren] The caps on the bottles,th',\n",
       "  'ey’re designed in such a way that they need to be destroyed to be taken off.[Catlin] In the lab, they have a device that cracks open the A sample.It’s the only way you can get it off.[Pound] If an A sample tests positive, then the B gets analyzed.The B has to confirm the A.That’s this enormous protection.[Rodchenkov] From Nagornykh, in preparation to Sochi, it was strict order to develop procedure how we can have new bottles, new caps or open cap.And this FSB officer, he was responsible for the day when I gave closed Bereg-Kit, and after half an hour, I receive it opened.And the… cap and the bottle are the same.And I can… [imitates pouring]A little bit rinse and then pour and close.[imitates lid locking]Like Bereg-Kit.It’s unbelievable how they could do this.This was named Operation Sochi Resultat.In Russian, “Resultat” means “to achieve positive results.”[Fogel] So, you need clean urines?[Rodchenkov] I need clean urines for each candidate.[Fogel] For every single Russian athlete under the state-sponsored doping, you had clean samples of their urine being held?Yes.[Fogel] If an athlete needed to be swapped, you could swap ’em.[Rodchenkov] Yes.But in Sochi, because of the Olympics, I am under double control.Both from IOC, WADA and I don’t know who.Level of security is stunning. It’s unbelievable.[Rabin] There was a delegation of foreign scientists who were embedded in the laboratory.So, if there were substitutions, manipulations, these people would’ve been in the front line to observe this.In Sochi, laboratory was like this.It was our entrance, but from this behind, where we have a fire exit, there is another building. It was a KGB building.And bank of clean urines were kept here.[man] Coming into the final two heats of the four-man bobsleigh, Pilot Alexander Zubkov and brakeman Alexey Voevoda…[crowd cheering]Gold to Russia, making their pilot the oldest man ever to win the four-man bobsleigh.[Fogel] So how many FSB officers were working at Sochi?Hundred.Throughout the day, our KGB officer brought the clean urines of all our athletes selected for testing to our secret operational room in the laboratory.Meanwhile, all the urines collected from the athletes during the day were transported to the Olympic village and held until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.Then I received a call.“Grigory, I will be delivering the samples in 15 minutes.”Before samples arrived, it gave me time to make sure that there were no WADA or IOC observers left snooping around the laboratory.Once samples were checked in, the operation entered the most dangerous phase.When the A and B bottles were split on to two different carts, my assistant wheeled the B bottles into a storage room and slipped the Russian athletes’ B bottles into his lab coat.This is highly illegal, but we need to replace these dirty urines.Then he wheeled the cart with the A bottles into the aliquoting room, as per procedure.[Fogel] ‘Cause it’s supposed to be opened.[Rodchenkov] For all A samples, yes.To escape all the video recording, aliquoting room was like this.And our room, we had the hole in it.So we take this little bit…How you say this thing? It’s…Uh…Like this, if you have something…You take this table out, and there is a… like a… like a power outlet blocked without any, uh… socket.Okay, right, right.But then you take it out.So it looks like it’s a power outlet without a socket, but it’s not.It’s not. It’s a hole.It’s a hole.[Rodchenkov] You’re taking both samples through this hole, and A samples, we immediately… pour away and clean.[Fogel] But the B sample…[Rodchenkov] B samples are taken by KGB and… whew!In the darkness, people coming from the trash/fire exit.[imitating footsteps]Then, after two hours, they came back with B bottles opened to swap.Because, of course, you have in advance clean urine.So, B samples are finished with the urine swapping.Taken by KGB and…[Fogel] Because the B samples are taken by the IOC and held in long-term storage.[Rodchenkov] Yes.[Fogel] If WADA or the IOC retest those samples, would they be clean?[Rodchenkov] Reanalysis will return negative.Because, you know, we are top-level cheaters.[chuckles]To over-cheat us, you should be much such experienced.But how it comes, such experience?[chuckles][Fogel] If there were evidence brought forward that showed that a country or WADA lab had found a way to break into the collection bottles, what do you think that would say about the entire testing system?What it would say is that corruption has gone to the depths of… that part of the process, which would be most disturbing.It would be, uh… obviously a very serious, serious act of manipulation from that lab.It would be done. It wouldn’t work.If that can be done successfully, then the testing system is over.[Fogel] Does WADA have the ability to catch drug cheats today?No.[choir singing Russian national anthem][Rodchenkov] Because of this whole steroid program, I pulled off 13 gold medals.It’s unbelievable.Never before. [chuckles]Everything was made clean, and Putin was very much happy.[anthem continuing][woman] Russia came out on top of the medals board, winning 33 overall, including an Olympic high of 13 gold.[crowd cheering][Rodchenkov] But immediately after, he started war against Ukraine.[man] Before the Olympics, his popularity rating in Russia had been falling steadily for years.But when the games began, this.[Rodchenkov] I felt my personal guilt for such event.Would Russia had less medals, Putin would be not such aggressive.[man] What you’re about to hear is not lifted from a Tom Clancy novel, nor is it borrowed from the elegant prose of John Le Carré or adapted from Robert Ludlum’s work.But if the protagonist is to be believed, this drama is the ultimate handiwork of Vladimir Putin and the intelligence successors to the KGB.LA may be a lot safer than Mother Russia, given the recent…Bryan![Fogel] Yeah?Article is incredible. It’s so very good.I am shocked. I’m reading twice.You know, Russia even cannot breathe.They still even don’t respond.Of course, there it is, midnight, but…[Fogel] Let me stop you.I just spoke to our lawyer.What happened?[Fogel] They’re not returning any of his calls.I am arrested?[Fogel] We don’t know yet. We’re in a holding pattern.I am sitting locked in my home. I’m a little bit afraid.[Fogel] Let me get this done, and I’ll come by, okay?Putin will kill me.[man 1] Rodchenkov…[man 2] …allegations…[woman] Dozens of Sochi medal winners were part of a secret…[Rodchenkov] Nine, one, seven.[overlapping chatter in Russian][exhales sharply] Okay.[man] He has since fled Russia because he said he feared for his life.[woman] Russia’s sports minister has dismissed the claims as nonsense, adding they were a continuation of the attack on Russian sport, which was backed up by the deputy sports minister.[in Russian] So that this is clear for everyone…there has never been and there is not any doping program.[woman] Vladimir Putin calls the claims “the slander of a turncoat.”[Fogel] We’re meeting with a white-collar attorney who has handled a lot of criminal cases.[man on phone] What happened with his other lawyer?[Fogel] His other lawyer, they have a Moscow office.It appears that the firm got cold feet due to a conflict of interest, they said.[man] Thomas Bach, who heads the IOC, said, “If this is true, it is an unimaginable level of criminality.”[woman] The IOC calling the report “very worrying.”[man] “We ask the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate immediately.”[man 2] The Justice Department is opening an investigation into Russian government officials, athletes, coaches and anti-doping authorities.[Fogel] This letter was sent by WADA.“Dear Grigory, in light of your recent declarations toThe New York Times, we would like to meet to better understand the basis of your allegations and your proposed way forward. Sincerely, David Howman and Olivier Niggli.”I’m talking tomorrow to a',\n",
       "  'nother lawyer.So…He seems credible, but of course, it’s his word against Russia.[man in Russian] There were older questions regarding Rodchenkov’s mental health in all this, as four years ago, after a failed suicide attempt, he was placed into a mental institution, the diagnosis described as the first stages of schizophrenia.[Rodchenkov] What to do with my wife and children? What they will know?Or I just disappear for them? They’ll go crazy.[Howman] Bryan, this is David and Olivier. We want this meeting to go ahead.Can you call us back?I’m not ready to answer.We need something lucky, like it’s Alice in Wonderland, to rabbit’s hole, to sit here.[Fogel] I know.[Rodchenkov] To wait until it ends.[Fogel] I know. That’s why I wanna… [chuckles]We’re trying to get this… To make it right.[Rodchenkov] But lawyer is trustful?[Fogel] He is a big one.[Rodchenkov] He’s a big one.[Fogel] Yeah, top of the top of the top.[Rodchenkov] Yes.[man in Russian] We are digging deeper into his identity.We’ve obtained some of his exclusive documents.[woman in Russian] Grigory Rodchenkov and American movie director Bryan Fogel, they talked many times via e-mail and wrote…[man in Russian] The FBI are following him closely, Grigory Rodchenkov himself mentioned to his sister in a recent Skype call.[Marina in Russian] Grish, just sit tight. Don’t be too impulsive.[Rodchenkov] No, of course I will not do anything…[Marina] Of course. Absolutely.[Rodchenkov] …without the protection of the FBI.[speaking Russian][man speaking Russian][in Russian] I refuse to make any comments on this. I’m very sorry.I’m sure you have very intelligent people who can explain all this.[Rodchenkov in Russian] Honey, I already spoke to the children. They’re fine.[Veronika] Grisha, now it’s another problem.I’m worried about you.[Rodchenkov] I’ll take care of this. Just hold on.[Veronika] This is what I’m worried about.They’re turning us into the monster now.Or trying to.[Radchenkov] It’s okay. We’ll get through this.[Veronika] What do you want to come of all this?[Rodchenkov in English] “To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free… when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone.”[Jim Walden] What everyone is interested in is the evidence he has, both in terms of the documents on his computer and the cell phone that he was using at the time.Two people connected with the Russian doping program are dead under circumstances that seem highly suspect.One of the first things that I learned from authorities when I came onto the case was that the Russian government has the resources and the will.So we’ve had to develop a very multi-stage protocol to minimize the chances our conversations will be intercepted.The main concern is that they would be able, through those communications, to try to triangulate his location, and if they have agents in the United States, then to do him harm.[man] We’re 84 days away till the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.[woman] Until now, there’s only been hard evidence about athletics, but this is pointing the finger at a whole range of sports.[Fogel] As you know, there’s a Department of Justice investigation going.Grigory’s been advised by his lawyer he should not be here for security reasons.I worked with Grigory over about six months to compile a record of what happened in Russia.This is the spreadsheet of every single athlete that was on the state-mandated protocol.What every single athlete was taking in London, including their sample numbers and collection.When Christiane goes back and tests these samples correctly, she will basically find them all positive.And we have all their protocols before the London Games.We have the same for Beijing.And this outlines how Russia was collecting thousands and thousands of clean samples for swapping.No, no, this we saw, but we want to ask question as well as how it was done, understanding…So, sodium chloride is added to the sample to increase specific gravity.Many of these samples are gonna have a hundred times the sodium content that should be in somebody’s urine.Let me make sure I understand.They were taking the B to be opened secretly?Yes.You said it was removed after the Paralympic Games.Does it mean that it happened also for the Paralympic Games?Yes, yes.Both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games, they swapped urine.Vancouver was really the impetus for the urine swapping operation.They only won a handful of medals, and to see to it that that didn’t happen again at Sochi.We’ll find that out when…In terms of time-sensitive, London is more sensitive, in the sense that these athletes are going to the next Rio Games, not the winter ones.[Fogel] This is Sochi. This is London. This is Beijing.This goes all the way back to 1968.There never was anti-doping in Russia. Period. Ever.Across all summer sports?Every sport.[Christiane Ayotte] He’s sorry?Who’s that?[Ayotte] Grigory.[man] I don’t want to get into that.Do you think, as a scientist, I am happy to have been in Sochi?And to everything… We gave credibility to the lab.Do you think that I feel good today?Do you think that the athletes who were cheated feel good?[Fogel] As angry as you guys might be, I think the one thing…Grigory risked his life, and is risking his life, to do this.He left his wife behind, he left his children behind, he left all of his belongings behind, all of his financial security behind.We’re here to get everything out.Okay.[Fogel] “Dear Mr. Fogel and Dr. Rodchenkov, the IOC has full confidence in the authority of Professor Richard McLaren and respects his judgment to ensure a comprehensive inquiry. We will act swiftly to take the necessary measures. Sincerely yours, Thomas Bach. President.”[automated voice] Transferring you to Richard McLaren.[McLaren] You speak of them as being orders. Are they actually orders?Nagornykh is ordering Grigory? Or ordering the lab?Does it matter?Yes, Nagornykh is ordering Grigory.There’s e-mails, like, explicitly about soccer players.There’s e-mails explicitly of, you know, of weightlifters.And that essentially were…Of rowers, of swimmers… where Grigory had found the positive.[McLaren] Then if they are concerned about it, they find the right profile in the bank, and pick that one out of the bank, and they run the analysis on that one?You got it.[McLaren] I see.If this all can be proved, it’s quite mind-blowing.The sooner I have it, the better.Okay.[McLaren] It’s important to a lot of people around the world.[Rodchenkov] We do it now?[Fogel] Yes.Russian athletes could not credibly return to international competition without undermining the confidence of their competitors and the public.[man] They are the pride and joy of Russian sport.But track and field stars, like pole-vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, won’t be going for gold at next month’s Rio Olympics, despite having friends in high places.[Yelena Isinbayeva speaking Russian]This is truly important to us, because…[sniffles][audience applauding]Today, our track and field team finds itself in a dire situation.We have been banned from the Olympicsvery aggressively, without any evidence or proof.[man in Russian] Rodchenkov, director of the Moscow WADA lab, was forced to resign from his position even though, when you think about it, he was a brilliant doctor.So he’s fired, and then somehow ends up in the United States, where he subsequently took his story to The New York Times.Not exactly the smallest paper on Earth.He gets there, he turns over all this information.Finally, he stated that the entire doping program was in fact part of a state-run system.Whatever he claims, he is confusing himself with the government.You see, all of his claims against the government, he did himself.It was a solo act.So the swapping, the destruction of samples, this was all just a farce?Again, I just don’t see how this is possible. How could it be?Please let me repeat, these allegations are ',\n",
       "  'not facts, just rumors and speculations.[woman in English] Welcome to the McLaren Independent Commission news conference here in Toronto.In May, Professor McLaren was mandated by the World Anti-Doping Agency with respect to the allegations made by the former director of the WADA-accredited Moscow laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.The investigation has established the findings set out in the report beyond a reasonable doubt.Our experts were to determine if samples had scratches and marks on the inside of the bottle caps, representative of a tool used to open the cap.Of the set of samples suspected of being swapped…we were able to confirm…100% had evidence of tampering.We’ve conducted cyber and forensic analysis, secured data from hard drives, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.The Moscow laboratory operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes within a state-directed, fail-safe system.Ministry of Sport, Deputy Minister of Sport Yuri Nagornykh, RUSADA, that’s the anti-doping agency in Russia, and the former director of the Moscow testing laboratory were all involved in this operation with the active participation and assistance of the Russian Federal Security Service, formerly known as the KGB.The FSB, who had access to the Sochi lab under the guise of the building maintenance contractor, can be identified in the evidence we have.Alex Mihailovich, RT.Rodchenkov himself is a person who’s under investigation in Russia currently.He took off from Russia.He seems to be a character that you really can’t rely on, and a lot of this relies on Rodchenkov.Does this compromise your work?He is a person in this investigation, but not the only person in this investigation.I can say without a doubt, Dr. Rodchenkov is telling the truth and was a truthful witness.I was able to corroborate that because of all the scientific and forensic information.My team can demonstrate the existence of this system beyond a reasonable doubt.[Reedie] It was clear from Richard McLaren’s report that was contained in our independent commission, it’s proven that offenses were committed.So, I don’t think anybody can accuse us of sitting back and doing nothing.[man] President Putin condemned the findings, saying the world is seeing a dangerous recurrence of politics interfering in sport.[man] Russia’s government says any decision which collectively punishes its competitors is unacceptable.Richard Conway, BBC News.[sighs]I’m gonna be rolling your hands like that.Let me do all of the work. It makes it easier for everybody.[Rodchenkov in Russian] What were you all doing today?[Veronika] We were worrying all day.But today, I was paying for everything, bills, etc.[Rodchenkov] Nika, we will get through this.Oh, you have new glasses![Veronika] Not that new.I have some sad news to tell you.Yes?I am going into the witness protection program.You are?Mm-hmm.Why?Because the current situation is unclear.So, this is serious?Yes.For a while?I was thinking of you yesterday.Well, visa is just one thing, but…You are my bride and keeper of the family and the dogs.Grigory, I was worrying all day, and on top of that, trying to reach you.Don’t tell anyone anything.Who would I even tell? I don’t see much of anyone these days.Maybe they’ll pay off some officials to sit in prison for some time?As a formality.I have to get going.Veronika?Yes?You wrote down the lawyer’s contact information and have everything?You know what I’m talking about?Of course I understand. It’s just… This is all so sad.[man in English] Whatever packing you need to do and getting dressed…[Rodchenkov] Okay. Okay.[speaking indistinctly][Fogel] So, do we know what, uh, you’re gonna be able to…[Rodchenkov] I still don’t know how it will be organized.“Protection” means protection that you don’t know how it’s organized.[Fogel] What do you foresee at this point?I will start writing book.

It dives into both the meteoric rise and the eventual fall of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French military leader who carved his name on the pages of history.The film opens in the throes of the French Revolution, where a young and audacious Napoleon (Phoenix) navigates the turbulent political landscape. His genius for strategy and battlefield leadership catapults him to prominence, culminating in a glorious victory at the Siege of Toulon (1793).Driven by an insatiable hunger for power and a burning desire to reshape Europe, Napoleon ruthlessly ascends the ranks, eventually crowning himself Emperor in 1804. His military campaigns across Europe bring him triumph after triumph, from the Battle of Austerlitz (1805) to the conquest of Prussia (1806).Yet, amidst the glittering victories, the film delves into the shadows of Napoleon’s personal life. His tumultuous relationship with his first wife, Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), is plagued by infidelity and ultimately ends in divorce. His obsessive quest for an heir leads him to marry Marie Louise of Austria (Jessie Buckley), a political alliance rather than a love match.Napoleon’s hubris, however, proves his undoing. The disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 marks a turning point, as the harsh winter and fierce Russian resistance decimate his Grand Army. Defeats mount, culminating in his exile to the island of Elba in 1814.But Napoleon is not one to surrender easily. In a daring escape, he returns to France and rallies his supporters in a final bid for power during the Hundred Days in 1815. His last stand comes at the Battle of Waterloo, where he faces the Duke of Wellington’s British-led army.Defeated once more, Napoleon is banished to the remote island of Saint Helena, where he spends his final years reflecting on his triumphs and failures. The film closes with a poignant look at the Emperor’s legacy, leaving viewers to ponder the complexities of a man who redefined history, only to be consumed by his own ambition.* * *[drumroll][guillotine falls][crowd cheering][breathes shakily][crowd shouting][guillotine falls][cheering][crowd shouting][breathing shakily][guillotine falls][fife and drum playing][cheering][horse hooves trotting][crowd jeering, clamoring]Get back, you lot.Get to the guillotine.[jeering, clamoring continue][breathing shakily][grunts][grunts][sighs][drumroll][laughing, cheering]The scourge of France![cheering]Terror is nothing more than justice.[people clamoring]Prompt, severe, inflexible.It is therefore an emanation of virtue.[clamoring continues]Now, she was guilty of three charges against you: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of state, and high treason for acting in the interests of the enemy.Mercy for the villains?No.Mercy for the innocent.Mercy for the unfortunate.[people cheering]Mercy for humanity.[clamoring][revolutionary] An inescapable outcome of democracy’s connection in relation to the nation’s immediate demands at this moment…The British navy have taken the port of Toulon.Half the French fleet is trapped there.If we lose those ships, the Republic will fall.Lucky for us, there are only 2,000 English troops in Toulon.But we are short of artillery and led by a general who was a court painter.It is not necessary to recapture Toulon itself.The town is not a town.

A prophecy and Gabe's fate with Medusa hint at future challenges  Episode Title:The Prophecy Comes TrueSeries:Percy Jackson and the OlympiansSeason:1Episode:8Original release date:January 30, 2024Episode plot summary:In the climactic episode of “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” Season 1, titled “The Prophecy Comes True,” Percy Jackson’s journey reaches a thrilling zenith. After a tense confrontation, Percy challenges the god Ares to a duel, managing to emerge victorious and secure both Zeus’s Bolt and the Helm of Darkness. He returns these powerful artifacts to their rightful owners, averting a divine war on Olympus. Despite Zeus’s initial hostility, a compromise is struck with Poseidon to address the looming threat of Kronos. Back at Camp Half-Blood, Percy’s valor is celebrated, but the peace is short-lived when he confronts Luke, unveiling him as the true thief and instigator of the conflict. Luke’s betrayal leads to a confrontation thwarted by Annabeth’s timely intervention, setting the stage for future adventures.

Although, just to be clear, no funeral. Any trace of you leaves a trace of my plan, and we can’t have that.It wasn’t your plan, though, was it? It was Kronos.[♪ music intensifies]It was his idea to frame Poseidon’s kid and steal Hades’s helm and Zeus’s bolt to start a war.What?Is that where he got to you, too?

Did you? You couldn’t… because you knew Clarisse didn’t steal the bolt. You did. You worked with Ares to plant it on me so when the shoes you gave me pulled me down into Tartarus, the bolt would be delivered right to Kronos.[♪ ominous instrumental music playing][Luke] I didn’t think you’d give ’em to Grover to wear.

Jackson) about the little differences regarding life in Europe…This scene fromPulp Fiction(1994) is a classic example of Quentin Tarantino’s unique style, blending casual conversation with deeper thematic elements.Setting:The scene takes place inside a car, early in the morning. Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, dressed in suits, are driving through the streets of Los Angeles. The atmosph',\n",
       "  'ere in the car is relaxed and casual, despite the fact that they are on their way to carry out a hit.Characters:Vincent Vega, played by John Travolta, is a hitman who has recently returned from a stint in Amsterdam. He’s laid-back, curious about the world, and keen on sharing his experiences in Europe.Jules Winnfield, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, is Vincent’s partner, another hitman. He’s more intense and philosophical than Vincent, but he’s equally engaged in the conversation.Dialogue and Action:• The conversation begins with Vincent sharing his experiences in Europe, particularly focusing on the legal status of hash and the culture around it in Amsterdam.• Jules, intrigued, asks questions, leadi',\n",
       "  'ng Vincent to explain the peculiarities of European laws and customs, such as the legality of hash bars.• The dialogue then shifts to the small, quirky differences Vincent noticed in Europe, like being able to buy beer in a movie theater in Amsterdam and the naming of fast-food items in France.• This exchange includes the famous lines about the “Royale with Cheese” and “Le Big Mac”, highlighting the novelty of the metric system’s impact on fast food in France.• The scene is marked by its relaxed, almost mundane tone, which stands in stark contrast to the violent nature of their profession.Cinematic Techniques:• Tarantino uses tight shots inside the car, focusing on the expressions and reactions of th',\n",
       "  'e characters as they speak.• The camera work is simple yet effective, capturing the casual nature of the conversation.• The dialogue-driven scene is a hallmark of Tarantino’s style, where the focus is more on what is being said than on any action.Overall, this scene is memorable for its ability to turn a simple conversation into something engaging and revealing about the characters. It sets the tone for the rest of the film, which balances dark humor, sharp dialogue, and intense action. This approach not only serves to develop the characters of Vincent and Jules but also cleverly juxtaposes the ordinary with the extraordinary, a technique that Tarantino has become known for.* * *VINCENT: “Well.”JULES',\n",

I mean you can’t walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin’ away. You’re only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.”JULES: “Those are hash bars?”VINCENT: “Yeah, it breaks down like this: it’s legal to buy it, it’s legal to own it and, if you’re the proprietor of a hash bar, it’s legal to sell it. It’s legal to carry it, which doesn’t really matter ’cause, get a load of this, if the cops stop you, it’s illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterda',\n",

A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they’re a little different.”JULES: “Examples?”VINCENT: “Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don’t mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald’s.

Suzumeis a 2022 Japanese animated film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai.Suzume, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a quiet town in Kyushu, meets a young man on a journey “looking for doors.” Suzume follows him to a dilapidated building in the mountains and finds a free-standing, undisturbed door as if “it” alone were saved from devastation. Suzume feels drawn by an invisible power and reaches out to the door. Soon, doors all over Japan start opening one after another. The doors that opened must be closed to shut out calamity that lies on the other side. The places she wanders into have a sky where all hours of the day seem to blend together. Beckoned by the mysterious doors, Suzume’s “journey of closing doors” begins.* * *Mommy?Mommy?Mommy, where are you?Mom?Suzume, are you up yet?Yes.There’s a high-pressure system over Kyushu…We expect blue skies and…Looks delicious!Don’t forget your lunch today.Okay.Oh, and Suzume…I’m going to be late tonight, so figure out dinner on your own.Do you have a date, Tamaki?Then, take all night!It’s overtime.The “Fisherman Experience” event prep.See you later.Beautiful…Hey… you.Do you know of any ruins in this area?Ruins…?I’m looking for a door.Well, there’s a little abandoned town over by that mountain…I see.Thank you.Huh?Did you watch yesterday’s livestream?It was amazing!Suzume!Good morning.Mornin’, Aya.Why’s your face all red?It is!?

That’s why I’m asking you.I say nowt. Just keep me mouth shut.[Laura] Here.Ta, thank you. [grunts][Laura] Erm… [sighs]Laura] Hi!Salam alaykum.Salam alaykum. Salam alaykum.For you, for the house.

There’s nothing new.I know, but they’ve been getting everything lately.Aye, but they’ve lost everything.That’s what you’ve gotta understand.They came to this country and had absolutely nothing other than the clothes on their back.[boy] Wish I could get a bike.You know, maybe you should do something for the local kids.Are you kidding us? Why don’t you do something?Start the football up again! No?! Thought not.Hey, man, I’m ran off me feet. I never stop.I’ve got bairns at home. I’ve got work.Me mam’s poorly. Our lad’s saying he never sees',\n",

I’ve gotta beg you to give us a lift in the van to drop some stuff off?!Are you kidding us? Howay, man!On your marks, get set.[whistle blows][shouts of encouragement][woman shouts in Arabic][woman] Olivia! Go on, Olivia!

Please, come.Well, that’s very kind of you.[Yara] Please, come.Thank you.[Yara chuckles, speaks in Arabic][woman speaks in Arabic][laughter][Yara] She’s, er… She’s making a joke of me.Like, now I am going to take pictures of everyone on the street, like I did in the camp.[TJ chuckles] Oh, right.Thank you.Shukran.Here, have some cakes.[TJ] Thank you.[Yara] Do you like it?Very good cake. Very nice.[Yara and woman speak in Arabic]Is the camera OK?It’s perfect. Like a new one.Shukran.Do you know what “shukran” means?[TJ] No.It means “thank you”.[TJ] Shukran.Shukran.It goes with your name. “Shukran, Mr Ballantyne.”Well, shukran.[women speak in Arabic]So, all the kids are in school now.So how’s it going?[Yara and girl speak in Arabic][Yara] Good.Good?[Yara] Yeah.School?

Rahat, Rafif, Sham, Shahad, Amara.[speaks in Arabic]So those are the names of her girlfriends back home.She doesn’t know where they are now.[girl speaks in Arabic][speaks in Arabic][Yara] This is our father, and she said she wish he can find us here.[TJ] I’m sure he will.[speaks in Arabic]Yeah, I’m sure he will.[Yara speaks in Arabic][mother speaks in Arabic][Yara] If you’ll excuse them, they have homework to do.[TJ] Yeah.So this is my father.[TJ] Yeah.He’s a tailor. Quick hands and quick mind.His only crime was to look for his brother.He was picked up by the shabiha. It means “the ghosts”.[TJ] Ghosts?They are state-sponsored militias of the Syrian regime.My mother thinks he’s dead. [sighs]But I know he’s still alive.Your father got you that camera, didn’t he?[Yara] Yeah.When I was a little girl, I told him I wanted to be a photographer and travel the world.So…This camera saved my life.[TJ] How’s that?Because I saw a lot of things I…I wish I hadn’t see.Don’t have the words to describe them.But when I look through this camera, I…I choose to see some hope and some strength.So I choose how I live with this camera.[TJ] Right.And I feel like… like my father is with me.So thank you for fixing it.It’s my pleasure.[boy] Go on!

That’s my nephew, right?Listen to what he says.“You know what you’ve done, we know what you’ve done.”Have you seen this, Charlie?[boys shout on video][Vic] See, that foreign bastard,he’s been bullying lasses at dinner time.He pushed one over. Yeah! Ask the parents.[TJ] I know the lad.He’s a good kid, he’s a decent lad.We’re just trying to figure out what happened.Well, summat’s gone on, TJ.Here, Gary, play that again.[boy shouts indistinctly][boy] Fucking go now!Go. Fuck off![boy 2] Go o',\n",
       "  'n!That’s what happens to bullies in our school.[Vic] See? Something happened before that.Aye, that’s your Ronnie responding, innit?Our Ronnie’s getting bullied on fucking social media now.They’re bloody fanatics, man.So what the fuck do you make of that then, TJ?I dunno.[Ed] Another pint? Anybody?[Vic] That all you can say?[man] I’ll force another one. Cheers, Eddy.[Vic] That’s all you can say, “Another pint?”[man] Hm-hmm!I better have your bitter.Cheers.[TJ] Right you are, mate.[Ed] Cheers.[TJ] Cheers.I mean, I’m no racist, but I’m not happy about the school.All those extra kids in there.And I don’t blame them, but some of them don’t even speak English!It’s holding everyone back.Exactly! Are there no more teachers?[man] Aye, they’re bringing someone in who speaks Arabic.Arabic? That’s great for our kids, that, innit?There was two of them in front of my cousin in the doctor’s trying to fill fucking forms out.That took half an hour.It was the same with Mary at the health centre.Funny, innit? They always put ’em round here, but never put ’em in Chelsea or fucking Westminster!Of course they don’t! They don’t want them living by them.That’s why they’re dumping them on us by the fucking busload.I mean, I’m not against refugees, immigrants.I mean, God, my father was Irish.But there’s fuck all in this village now.And we’re supposed to share it with that lot?We don’t even know them.And if you say anything about it, all the posh wankers make you out to be a racist.I’m fucking sick of it.[Vic] So am I. I’m sick of it.What about the background checks?You know what I mean? Who are these people’s wives?Who are they married to? Who’s their brothers? Cousins?[man] They’ve all got smartphones.Face to face with fighters in a war zone.All it takes is one of them to slip through.One crazy fucking jihadi.I feel sorry for the poor bastards. I honestly do.Well, me an’ all, Jaffa, but what can we do?We can’t even look after our own.Bang on! People living in fucking boarded-up houses, eh, with candles on?They’ve never had any fucking respect for us round here, ever.Well, I say we should draw a line in the sand, eh?Enough’s enough. It starts here, this village.This pub, The Old Oak. We should have a public meeting and tell everybody how we’re feeling.Invite everybody.The local council, the press, Tyne Tees telly.You need to be careful, Charlie. You get a load of racists in.There’s plenty of them about. We don’t need it![Vic] Jaffa, as far as I’m concerned, it’s now or never.Where would we hold it? Everywhere’s closed.There’s the church hall, the miners’ welfare, even the school’s gone!Well, you opened the back room the other day there, TJ.We could have it in there.Aye.[TJ] It’s been shut for 20 years.The place is an absolute tip.[Vic] We could help you clean it up, couldn’t we, lads?Do that, aye.Yeah, course we could!There’s nay heating, the plumbing’s knackered, and the electrics are fucked. That’s a non-starter.[Vic] Jaffa’s done time in the building trade.Couldn’t you help out, Jaffa?No, count me out. I’ve got a bad back.[laughter][Vic] Fucking lazy bastard!What about the cookers, TJ?[TJ] Cookers?Aye.[TJ] They haven’t worked since the ’90s, man.We’d blow ourselves up using them.I’ll strip them down. I’ve got time.Oh, anyway, we don’t need cookers.We don’t need any food or nowt.All we need is a room for a few hours for a meeting.Now what’s the problem?I haven’t got public liability insurance.So I can’t have any public functions in there.[Charlie] You’re a stickler for the rules all of a sudden!Do you mind if I go and have a look meself?[Vic] Go on, Charlie. Go on, son.[Gary] Hey, the keys are behind the bar. Come on, open it up.[TJ] The room stays closed.Hey, do you know what it is, TJ?Some of us have been drinking in this pub for 40 years.That’s a lifetime, man.Me and Mary, we had our engagement party in that room.You were there, you remember?Course I can, mate.Aye, course you can.Cos you made a lovely speech, didn’t you?“Marras for life” and all that.Aye.And now you won’t even open the room for us,but you’ll open it for your new mates?What’s that? Do we not count all of a sudden?[Vic] Aye.[TJ] I’m sorry, mate. I’m sorry. But that room stays shut.[Vic scoffs][Jaffa] Howay, then.[Eddy] Aye, fair enough. Fair enough.[TJ] Sorry, Charlie.[Vic] Fucking disgraceful.Sit down, Charlie.He’s changed.[Vic] Absolutely.[subdued chatter]Can I have a word with you?Nadia… [speaks urgently in Arabic][woman] Yeah, you! I need to talk to you.I didn’t know what happened with Linda the other day.I’m really sorry.I just wanted to apologise.I’m sorry too, for entering your house.I should have asked.You know, Linda showed me the photographs you took of her.They’re really lovely. They’re so natural.And she looks happy for a change.What I wanted to ask you, I showed the pictures to the girls in the salon.I’ve got a little cleaning job there, just a few hours a week. They would really like it if you come and took some pictures of them, as well.Really? Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.[lively chatter][woman] Just be careful.Yeah.Can you look at the camera, please?You want us to look at you?Yeah. Look here.[camera beeps, clicks]So this is Debbie. Yara.[camera beeps, clicks][overlapping chatter][camera beeps, clicks][camera beeps, clicks]Are you enjoying doing this, then?[Yara] Yeah, very much.Thank you for letting me take your photos.Ah, you’re welcome.Oh, nice cup of tea.There you go.Oh, that’s fantastic, thank you.There you are, Yara.Thank you.Nice brew for you, darling.So how’s Linda?Yeah, she’s good!She’s doing better.Yeah?She’s back at school.Nice and hot.Can I just ask you something?Yeah.Do you do, erm… like, a gift voucher?Ah. No, Sadie.We’re, like, a simple outfit, so…Oh, do you not?It’s just, you know me daughter Josie?Hm-hmm.It’s her birthday coming up.She hasn’t been out for months.Right.I was just thinking it would be lovely, maybe, for her to…She could do with having her hair done and…I mean, she’s got her nails, but, oh, they’re a mess.They really need doing!And, you know, if I give her money to get it done, it’ll go straight out for the kids.Yeah.I’ve got a friend going through exactly the same thing, Sadie.It’s awful.She lost all of her confidence. She’s just hiding away.Yeah.We just never see her.She’s just so lonely. It really breaks my heart.[Linda’s mother] And they feel ashamed, don’t they?That’s what happened to my Katie.She just got left by the wayside.Oh!I don’t e',\n",
       "  'ven know where she is.Don’t know if she’ll ever come back.That’s £5.20, there, boy.Money’s just there.Champion.Cheers, mate.Thanks, TJ.[TJ] Got a friend for life, there, mate!Ah, she’s nay bother! Canny little dog.[TJ] Ah, she’s a belter.[Laura] TJ?Yep?[Laura] Can we have a word?Hm-hmm.Yara and me have been having a think.[laughs] Oh, that’s reassuring![laughs] No, not like that, honestly!Erm, just, Yara was at the hairdresser’s the other day…Right.…talking to the lasses.And you know what it’s like, people are really struggling.And she was talking to Sadie about her daughter, Josie.Christ, I haven’t seen her in months.Aye, exactly.She’s, like, really hiding herself away, right?I’ve been thinking, Mr Ballantyne.Our families, the Syrian families, are so isolated, and worried for their kids.Some of the locals here are struggling too.[TJ] Ah, I know. Some of the stories I hear in here, man.It’s absolutely heart-breaking.[Laura] Exactly, so…So that photo, in the backroom. What your mother said to you.“If you eat together, you stick together.”Right?Yeah.So, imagine if all the families mix and start to eat together.We can become friends.This could really change our life forever.What do you think?Well, sounds like a great idea.But do you not think you’re taking too much on?Why, no, man. Our mams did 500 meals a day during the strike.We can pull off a dinner for a couple of people from the village.If we just start small, maybe, with the people who need it the most, like Josie.And we could maybe ask Brendan from the school which of the other bairns might need it.Start off like that.You can borrow the van any time you want, if that’ll help.The thing is, is there’s nowhere really to do it anymore.The church hall’s gone.And that was the last suitable place.So we were thinkingmaybe we could use the back room?[sighs] Are you trying to embarrass us?[Laura] No.That’s been shut up for 20 years.[Laura] We were just thinking we could get people in…The plumbing’s knackered, the electric’s knackered.[Yara] Some of our men are builders. They can come…It’s not safe, Yara! You know that.You know it’s not safe in there! What are you playing at, Laura?How am I, TJ?[TJ] Are you trying to fucking ruin us?No, we’re trying to do something for the village!Even though I could open that back room, the last few regulars I’ve got left would fucking boycott us.[Laura] Oh! Here!I’m hanging on by my fingertips here!I can’t sell the place.I haven’t got a penny to me fucking name!Do you want us out on the street?No. No, of course not.Cos that’s what’ll happen!Laura, just fucking leave it, right?Just get off me back and leave it!Yara, I’m sorry.[exhales][gentle piano music]Good girl. Come on.[sighs][breathes deeply][exhales sharply][birds flutter][Marra barks][TJ] Marra![Marra barks]Leave it!Marra!Leave it! Marra, leave it! Leave it!Marra! Leave it!Marra!Marra![dogs bark]Marra![dogs bark][boy] Come on, girl, down!Marra![dogs barking][boy] Yo, man, you fucking prick! Come on!Get your fucking dog back![TJ] Oh, fuck, no.Get those bastards under control!For fuck’s sake, man![boy] I told you not to do this!Marra![boy] Get them back, man![dogs bark][boy] Come on!Marra![boy] Fuck’s sake!Marra![boy] Fucking grab him, man![dogs bark]Marra![boy] Get his head!Get a hold of the fucking thing, man![TJ] Fucking size of it, man![Marra yelps and whines][boy] We need to go now.

Can we come in?[TJ] Yeah, course you can.Please… [clears throat]Take a seat.[Yara] Thank you.[mother speaks in Arabic]Er, bring a plate. Just for yourself.[rattling][speaks in Arabic]Sometimes in life, there is no need for words, only food.You make me feel quite ashamed.After what you’ve been through, to do this for me…[translates into Arabic][speaks in Arabic][Yara] Hm-hmm.[speaks in Arabic]There is no shame in love, Mr Ballantyne.We understand loss. Please, take a seat.Thank you.[speaks in Arabic]You will like the food.[chuckles] I’m sure I will.[speaks in Arabic]She won’t leave until you eat.[laughs]OK.That’s very nice.Thank you.Shukran?[Yara] Shukran.Shukran.[mother speaks in Arabic]Thank you.[TJ chuckles softly][dishes clattering]When did you get Marra?April the 9th, two years ago.You remember the date?[TJ] Yeah.It’s a very special date to me.My father was a miner, as you know.On April the 9th, many years ago now… he was working on a seam three mile out to sea, and he was killed in an accident.So two years ago, my life was in such a mess… I decided that on April the 9th… I would take my own life.Now, I don’t know, that may be hard for you to understand.It’s not hard.Yara, I just made so many mistakes.I’d just lost a good woman.I made time for everybody except her, and by the time I realised…Well, it was too late. She wanted a divorce.[Yara] Do you have any children?Yeah. I have a son.He’s a good lad, but he doesn’t speak to me anymore.And I can’t blame him.I just kept hurting everybody that I loved and cared for.I mean, this place, The Old Oak, it’s dropping to bits.And I can’t get it fixed.So when it was coming round to April the 9th two years ago, I realised I had a way out.So I made a decision… to take me own life.I walked down to the beach, I took a bearing from the old pit head and I looked out at the horizon.And I just thought to meself, “If I can get three mile out there… just above where me father died…”I thought, “That’ll do me.”I couldn’t come back from that, I knew that.I even left a note on this table.“Tommy Joe Ballantyne’s gone for a swim.”So… I stepped into the sea.And that’s when it happened.Now, I’m not a religious person.I don’t believe in God, the afterlife, any of that.But as I stepped in the sea…[distant bark]…I heard this noise.And I looked around.[barking]And there was this daft little dog coming towards us.[TJ chuckles]I remember thinking, “Not now.”“Not today of all days.”But it just kept coming.It came right up to me feet.And I looked down and I saw it had a name tag.And it said “Marra”.See, “marra” is an old miners’ word.Your marra is your friend, but it runs much deeper than that.He’s your friend, he’s your equal.He’s got your back, you’ve',\n",
       "  ' got his.You keep each other safe.So all I could think of was, “What would my father think of me?”So I stepped back.Brought the daft little dog home with us.She gave us a reason to get out of bed.Every time I looked at Marra…I saw the little dog that gave us a second chance.[chatter]Youse all right?Hi, lasses, you all right?You all right, Maggie? Just come to see how TJ is.He’s all right. He’s all right.He’s in the back. God knows what he’s doing.He’s in the back?Aye.Erm, the door’s not locked if you wanna go in.TJ?[clattering][clattering]Get that, Yara. TJ?[knocks]Oh!You all right? What are you doing?What does it look like I’m doing?I’m cleaning the kitchen.You’re to blame for this, the pair of youse!Er… well, good.[TJ] Yeah.So, off with your coats, and get your backsides in here and give us a hand.Right. We’ll come back later.No, no, no! You’re not going anywhere!I’ve started this cos of you.[Yara laughs]Get in here, give us a hand.OK. OK.Yeah, right?Come on.Right.Uh-huh.Great.I’ve got plenty of cleaning stuff. Come on.[chatter][TJ] A couple of people came to me very recently with an idea that I reopen this room.And I wasn’t receptive at all.But what I wanna do now, with your help, is I wanna reopen this room.And I wanna help the kids in this village who are in desperate need of our help and in need of a meal.So then, Tony, are we safe?Aye. I’ve replaced these three fuses here.Right.Erm…But long term, it needs sorting out, like, cos otherwise you’ll have a bit of an issue on your hands.But for now, you’re safe.[TJ] I want to welcome our new friends who have left a war zone, come to our community.And what I want to do is I want to use this space so we meet together and we sit down and eat together.That’ll need a big scrub.If you can take that rubbish out, that would be great.Anything that looks as though it’s unsafe, or needs chucking out, exactly, needs to go.[TJ] This is solidarity. It’s not charity.This is about, we do something together.It’s not just about putting some food on a table as a one-off.I want this to be ongoing.[Jaffa] How are you getting on, Mo? Mo, you good?No, no.[Jaffa] No?No. Rust.Rust?[Mo] Rust, yeah.I can get you some WD-40 for that.That’s not a problem. Do you wanna check that one?[man] Yusuf?[Jaffa] All right, is it safe?[speaks in Arabic][Jaffa] Savvy? Does that mean safe? Yusuf?[speaks in Arabic]How are we getting on?They don’t understand a word I say.I’m struggling, mate. I’m struggling.Right, well, where’s Yara?She’s up translating with Betty, up there.I didn’t want to interrupt.No, can’t interrupt that.[quiet chatter]Hi.[Maggie] Hiya. You all right?Can I put these things in for TJ?Yeah, you can. Put them on the bottom table there.[speaks in Arabic][Maggie] Hiya, you all right?[regulars mutter][woman] Hi.[Maggie] Hi. You all right?[woman] Hi.[Vic] Hi.[Mo] All right?[regulars] All right.[Vic] All right, yeah.[Mo speaks in Arabic][regulars mutter]Food on the table?Wonderful.[chatter in Arabic][Vic mutters] Away you go.[regulars mutter][Mo] Yusuf![men speak in Arabic]Hello.[Maggie] Hiya, you all right?[Yusuf] Hiya.[Maggie] Hiya. All right?[Yusuf] Yeah, good.[Vic] Fucking Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, innit? Huh?Oh, for fuck’s sake. Howay, I’m gonna go sit down there.[mimics gunshot] Doing my fucking brain in.[chatter in Arabic][Charlie] Just come in for a quiet pint, man, Maggie.Is that too much to ask for?[Maggie] Charlie, it’s TJ’s idea.[Charlie] Yeah, I bet it fucking is, an’ all.See you, bye.[Maggie] See you.Bye.See you, bye.[Vic] All right. Ta-ra.Bye.[Vic] Right. Bye.Bye.Ta-ra. See you later. Bye. Have a nice day.[Mo] Thank you.Aye.Fuck off.The pub’s not ours anymore, is it?[Ed] Hello, Tony. What are you doing here, son?All right, Uncle Ed?[Ed] Why aye.Aye, the gaffer sent us over to check on some wiring.[Vic] I hope you’re getting paid, son.Ah, usual rate! Nah, we’re doing a favour for TJ.All chipping in to help out.[Vic scoffs]Anyway, I’ll catch you later on.Pint later on, eh?Aye! Why aye!Oh!Thank you.Hi, there. Is it OK to leave these here for TJ, please?Aye, just put them on this bottom table there, pet.[Ed] It’s like Grand Central Station.What the fuck’s this all about?A car boot sale or something?Can you tell Laura that’s from the Fire Brigades Union, and there’s more on the way.[Maggie] All right, OK.Also, erm, I’ve found an industrial juicer.Erm, can you just tell her that Sammy’s got it?It’s second-hand but it’s in good nick.I’ll drop it off later on.[Maggie] All right.OK? Thank you.[Maggie] OK. Bye, pet.You all right there, lads?[regulars] Aye.Enjoy your pint.[Ed] Aye. Great.[Charlie laughs]An industrial fucking juicer.What the hell’s next, eh?A fucking Jacuzzi!Fucking unions need to mind their own business.Too much time on their hands.It’s getting like fucking Panama Canal in here, innit, eh?Aye. You’re right there, lad.Another pint please, Maggie.[Maggie] Hm-hmm.Anyone else?[Ed] No.[man] No, I’m all right.All right, Maggie.[Charlie] So…Back room’s not good enough for us,but it is good enough for them, is that it, TJ?Hadn’t planned it, Charlie.All it is, is a few of the locals trying to give a helping hand to those that need it.It’s a few volunteers doing it.You and your family are more than welcome to come.[Vic] Aye, OK then.What’s your problem, Vic?I’ll tell you the problem, shall I?The problem is we drink in here all the time, keeping you in business, and you treat us like fucking shit.[TJ] I don’t treat you like fucking shit.Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. We asked you for a favour, mate.One favour for a meeting. One fucking meeting.And all you did was give us a load of excuses.But with these fuckers, right, you can give them what they fucking want.As far as I’m concerned, mate, you’re a fucking two-faced, forty-faced arsehole.[Ed] Easy, man.[Charlie] Aye, just calm down, Vic.I mean, look at the place, TJ.It’s like a bloody refugee camp. It’s a shithole.That’s sad coming from you, mate.[Vic] You’re the one that’s fucking sad, mate.I tell you what it is, right? I’m just trying to work it out.Either you’re going for the OBE for charity work, or you’re shagging her in the fucking cellar.Fucking watch your mouth, pal![Vic] Make me!

[breathes deeply]Someone saw him in the prison. Please, don’t stop.Sometimes I wish he was dead, we had his body and I could bury him.[sighs]Where he is, there’s a hundred people into one cell.So packed they take turns to sit down.[sighs]Starved, beaten.Only few survive.[sighs]This is what the Assad regime does to us.It’s the hope that causes so much pain.I’m so sorry, Yara.But I have to be strong for my family.And community.But it’s all just… a big act.TJ, we’re getting a donation from the Cathedral.Can you go and collect it, please?Aye, cheers, Phil, will do, mate. Thank you.[Phil] Thank you.So that’s the Cathedral.[Yara] Wow.[TJ] Built nearly a thousand years ago by the Normans.Me father loved it.But he always said that the Cathedral doesn’t belong to the Church, it belongs to the workers that built it.We used to love coming every July to watch the blessing of the miners’ banners, and then go on to the big meeting.He used to love all the speeches and the bands.Just like in the photos.Yeah, just like in the photos.Can we go?It’s been a long time since I went.So it’s probably best if you go with Laura.[man] It’s those as well, mate.[TJ] Right, cheers, Geoff.[TJ grunts]Leave that, leave that.Tell you what, if you hurry up, you can see the choir practice.Really?

Palmyra.Built by the Romans and destroyed by the Islamic State.When you have half of your country in rubble and you see this… [sighs]It makes me want to cry.What will Syria be like in a thousand years?[sighs]How many years to cut the stones… to lift the weight, to imagine the light?How many brilliant minds? How much sweat?How many people working together?[sighs]Such a beautiful place… makes me want to hope again.When they torture, when they target hospitals, when they murder doctors, when they use chlorine gas, when the world stands by and does nothing, that’s when the regime lives.When the world does nothing.That’s what they do to break us.It takes strength to hope, but they want to smash it.It takes faith to hope.[sighs]We tried to build something new, something beautiful, and look at us.Thrown to the wolves.I have a friend who calls hope “obscene”.Maybe she’s right.But if I stop hoping, my heart will stop beating.[Arabic music][quiet chatter][quiet laughter][audience] Aw.[quiet chatter][audience] Aw.

We’ll have to get Tony down here.It’s just going from bad to worse, isn’t it?[click][Tony sighs][Tony] It’s not looking good, TJ.Jaffa’s meant to have told them Syrian lads to double-check them joints.And that’s what’s gone, so… they either weren’t listening to him or didn’t understand him.I cannot believe that’s just gone straight in the electrics.I don’t know, TJ. Just… everything’s ruined.Everything we’ve worked for.Sorry, TJ, mate. They’re done.Total rewiring. It’s a big job.And you can’t use this room. Nay chance. It’s not safe.[Maggie] Tony, what about the bar?Or have I screwed that up as well?It’s on a separate ring main, so the bar’s fine.But it’s not your fault, Maggie. It would make no difference.Your boiler, that’s fucked.That’s gonna cost you about two grand.And then just look at the floor.It’s soaked the joists and the subfloor.It’s gonna cost you a fortune![Laura] Wait, the insurance will cover it, won’t it?No, it won’t.We cut this room off from the insurance because it wasn’t being used by the public.So in order to bring the cost down… we didn’t need it.Youse haven’t got insurance?I couldn’t afford it.So, what am I gonna say to the kids now, eh?[indistinct chatter]Hello, mate. Can I have two pints of lager, please, man?Of course you can, mate.I’ll tell you what, we need to fucking give them some…[mutters]Happen so.Like, the person sitting watching TV, doing this, and you’re sort of going… like that.And then in the actual cinema itself, you can just hear…It’s a great atmosphere tonight, TJ. Huh?I mean, the place is bouncing, innit?Aye, just like the old days. Banging.[Vic laughs]None of the fucking missionary work going on next door.No.Just peace and quiet.Here.Cheers.Nay problem, cheers.Thank you.‘Ey up, mate.

Leave it out, will you?I’m trying to have a good night over here.[Vic] We’re just chatting, you know.Bit of sympathy for the lad, you know what I mean?[Vic] I tell you what it is, TJ.Maybes it wouldn’t have happened if you’d used an English plumber instead of one of those fucking foreign cowboys.That’s the trouble, you know, these days.Cheap foreign labour. It’s shite.[Gary] Useless.[Vic] Fucking crap.I heard a rumour about no insurance.[Vic snorts]Is that true?[TJ] Here.Ah![Gary] Sometimes we just don’t get round to these things.You know how it is. Busy lives and that.You’ll not be selling this place in a hurry.Mind, you’ve gone very quiet.What’ve you got to say for yourself?Tell you what I’ve got to say for meself.Why don’t you just shut the fuck up?Oh!

[sighs]But you’ve got to promise it’s just between us, aye?You’ve got me word.Uncle Eddy and couple of the lads,Gary and Vic, came round my house after the pub closed.You know how my father’s got a load of drink stashed in the shed?And I’m in the kitchen making summat to eat and I can hear every word.And you know what Vic’s like when he’s had a drink.He becomes more of a fucking dickhead than he already is.[TJ] Aye.And he’s shouting off to me father and showing off.Everyone, everyone knew the plumbing in the back room was dodgy.And I hear Vic explain that the water pressure rises at night.And all they had to do was loosen the joint between the tank and the pipe… and as the water pressure rises, it would give way and… nobody would know.Bastards.Wasn’t just the drink talking?No.I heard them say it.They wanted to put the back room out of action and blame the…Blame the ragheads. That’s what they said.Fucking bastards.So that’s Vic, Gary and your Uncle Eddy.Anybody else involved?Charlie.Nah, not Charlie.Charlie was the one who forced the window open.No, I cannot believe that. Not Charlie.[Tony] I heard Vic say Charlie wanted to teach you a lesson.Apparently, him and Mary got engaged in that back room.[TJ] Aye.And he wanted a favour. Like, one meeting in there.And you blanked him.Vic said Charlie felt humiliated.Fuck.We went to school together.In the same class at school.We used to eat at each other’s houses when we were bairns.His father was down the pit with mine.[sighs]You all right?Charlie, look at the state of the whole village, man.Look at all the crap that’s happened to us over the years.The stuff that’s happened to you, the stuff that’s happened to me, and both of our fathers.This place has been going to shite for years, long before the Syrians got here.Now, I know you’re not a stupid man.So how have you become this?I… I don’t know what you’re on about, man.We all look for a scapegoat when life goes to shit, don’t we?We never look up. It’s always look down.Blame the poor bastards below us.It’s always their fault.That makes it easier to stamp on the poor bastards’ faces, doesn’t it? Eh?I just want you to know, Charlie…I know.I know.Obviously, the situation’s not good.Erm, but it’s really good to know people want to help.And, you know, ',\n",
       "  'everyone wants to help.I’m gonna speak to Margaret and Jaffa later, as well.They just couldn’t be here.But first things first, really.We need to think about talking to the families.There’s people expecting food today.TJ, I don’t suppose you’ve made a start, have you?Aye, the kids got to us.Erm…Linda just said, “It’s OK, TJ, nothing good ever lasts.”Little Ryan just said, “I knew it. I knew it.”Called us a liar and walked away.And Max wouldn’t even look us in the face.Listen… that’s awful.This is awful. But we cannot be beaten by it.This is the best thing that’s happened to our community for years.[Archie] I mean, I can get back to me mates in the trade union movement.Try and get some new funding. There must be cash somewhere.Why aye. And there’s… and there’s local churches, there’s local business, shops.We can get there.It’ll take time. But we can get there.[TJ] How many times have we heard that over the years, eh?I’ve spent a lifetime trying to get there.And I’ve never got close.It was just self-delusion.Whether it’s the strike… this fucking pub… the village.I mean, half the country’s fucking rotten.But, Laura, you know what is getting there?It’s hate, lies, corruption.It stinks to high heaven.And betrayal.[Archie] What?Because what happened here wasn’t an accident.Betrayal? That’s a strong word, TJ.[Laura] Eh?You’re gonna have to tell us a bit more about that, mate.What do you mean, no accident?TJ, you’re gonna have to tell us.[Archie] You’re gonna have to tell us. It’s that word, mate.It’s not the time, it’s not the time.[Laura] TJ, please tell us.You can’t say “betrayal” and not tell us some more, mate.[Yara] What do you mean?Betrayal by who?Just shut the fuck up!I cannot do this anymore. I cannot.All that matters is they closed me down.Cos we tried to help some families coming from a fucking war zone.Tried to help families who have to choose between feeding their bairns and heating their house.Families humiliated cos they can’t feed their kids… in one of the richest countries in the fucking world.And we were helping them. We were doing something good.And the bastards closed we down.[Laura] TJ…Listen, TJ. I know, mate, but…You’ve hardly slept. Please try and take it easy.[TJ] I’ve been asleep for years, love.I saw it on the kids’ faces.I saw it on the faces of those bastards next door, who took the piss out of me all day.Who stood and fucking smirked, took the piss, fucking thought this was clever, funny…They get shit dumped on them all the time, crap served on top of it.They say nowt, they don’t complain.They just accept it, that that’s the norm.They’re just fucking doormats.If you expect nothing, you get nothing.They fucking… [sighs]Say nowt, look after your own, eh?Law of the fucking jungle.That’s what they’ve learned around here.[Yara] Mr Ballantyne?Mr Ballantyne, please believe.I can’t, Yara.I can’t.I’m done.It’s over.Oh, man!

It is a prequel to the 1971 filmWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.The film opens in a world far from the chocolate rivers and Oompa Loompas. We meet a young Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) living a humble life with his inventor father (Colin Firth) in a small town. Willy’s imagination, however, knows no bounds. He’s constantly concocting wondrous inventions and dreaming of creating magical confections.Willy’s world crumbles when tragedy strikes his family, forcing him to leave his home and embark on a journey to the bustling city of Scuttleburgh. There, he faces poverty and hardship, but his passion for chocolate never wavers. He even finds a friend in the resourceful and street-smart Noodle (Calah Lane).A stroke of luck lands Willy a job at Mr. Scrump’s chocolate factory. This gloomy, industrial place is a far cry from Willy’s vision. However, it’s here that he learns the basics of chocolate-making and starts to experiment with his own unique flavors and creations.Willy’s talent and imagination soon draw the attention of Mr. Bucket (Hugh Grant), a rival chocolatier. Mr. Bucket sees potential in Willy and becomes his mentor, providing him with resources and encouragement to follow his dreams.Guided by Mr. Bucket and fueled by his own boundless creativity, Willy sets out to create his own chocolate heaven. He hatches a plan to build a magnificent factory unlike any other, filled with fantastical machines, innovative sweets, and singing Oompa Loompas.The film culminates in the opening of Willy Wonka’s factory, a joyous celebration of Willy’s genius and dedication. Through his journey, Willy not only creates a world of wonder but also learns valuable lessons about friendship, perseverance, and the power of believing in one’s dreams.Wonka(2023) is a delightful origin story that offers a fresh perspective on a beloved character.

Try one.Wish you hadn’t done that.You don’t like it?No,I like it.

Just get me out of here.[gasps] Are you crazy?Shh!It’s easy. I’ll get someone to cover my shift, and you could smuggle me out in your laundry cart.But I…Just for a few hours, mind.No one will even know I was gone.What’s the point of that?To sell chocolate, o’ course! We’ll split the profits and pay off Mrs. Scrubitt in no time.It’s a nice idea, Willy.It’s a great idea.But it’ll never work.‘Course it will. Eat your chocolate.[Noodle] You don’t understand.Mrs. Scrubitt’s like a hawk.

It’s given you an idea.Okay. So, the one time she dropped her guard was when this aristocrat came to the laundry.He was only asking for directions, but she was all over him like a rash.It was disgusting.That’s it, Noodle.All we have to do is find an aristocrat and slip out while she’s distracted.Yeah, but… where are we going to find an aristocrat?[ding]Huh.Huh?Huh.A double huh.Do you have a pencil and paper?Uhhuh.I got an idea.[distant singing][soft music playing][male choir singing][knocks along to song][lock clicks]I’ve come to make a confession.[singing continues]You sound great, fellas.

That, my dear Noodle, is why we’re very lucky the Little Orange Man didn’t find this.What is it?[Noodle] From Zoo Management.In recognition of your years of service.But I’ve only been here a year.Which is why there’s only one chocolate.Huh.Well, thank you very much.[Noodle] You’re welcome. Good night![whispers] Hey, well done, Noodle.So, what is it really?It’s called A Big Night Out.A single chocolate that perfectly mimics a night on the town.[guard] Mmm.The outer layer, a champagne truffle.[guard] That’s lovely.[Willy] The next is white wine.[guard] Mmm.

But these guys… [hesitates]We don’t need to go into detail.Goodbye, Mr. Wonka.[bones crunching][groans softly][exhales sharply][huffs][Willy] Thank you.[flute plays lilting tune][Oompa Loompa music plays]♪ Oompa Loompa doompetydee ♪♪ I’m not in premium economy ♪♪ I’d go first class If I were you ♪♪ That’s what Oompa Loompas ♪♪ Doompetydo! ♪[music ends][chuckles]So glad you’re here.Oh, I’m not going to let you out of my sight, Willy Wonka.Not till you’ve paid your debt.But I bring glad tidings on that score.What’s that?I’ve been doing my sums.One more jar, and we’re even.Or, if you prefer, I will accept half a jar of those rather amusing Hoverchocs.[ice rattling]You’re outta luck.I don’t make chocolate anymore.Oh, dear, please don’t tell me you’re going to go through with this ridiculous deal?I have to.For Noodle.I promised her a better life.I pinkie promised.You should stand up to those bullies.Give ’em the old one-two.That’s what an Oompa Loompa would do.[exhales]But if you are determined to just sit there feeling sorry for yourself,I am going flat.Good night, sir.[chair whirring][Willy] Huh.[chair whirring][inhales] What is it?No, nothing.Well, it’s obviously something because you said, “Huh.”I’m sorry. Forget it.Very well.[chair whirring]Huh.Oh, you did it again.[chair whirring]Tell me what it is, or I shall poke you quite viciously with a cocktail stick.Look. Where Slugworth shook my hand.His ring left a mark. See?It’s an “A,” surrounded by “S”s.So what? His name is Arthur Slugworth.It’s probably a family ring.Yes, but Noodle has one just like it.Noodle?Uhhuh.Why would Noodle the orphan have a Slugworth family ring?There’s only one reason I can think of.Which is?And if I’m correct, Noodle could be in grave danger.Well, come on, Wonka. Spit it out.Produce your owl pellet of wisdom.There’s no time. I gotta get back.Captain!Wonka?Come back here. Wonka! I demand an explanation.Captain?On second thoughts, the explanation can wait.Good day to you.[water splashes][water splashes][chief] Well, gentlemen, one dead chocolatier, as requested.Miss BonBon?[Miss BonBon] Yes, Mr. Slugworth?Give the chief his chocolate.[Mrs. Scrubitt] My, my.What a lot o’ long faces this morning.It’s almost as though you lot had a sneaky little scheme to try and wriggle out of your contracts.Which spectacularly misfired.[Bleacher grunts, chuckles]But I’ve got some good news for you lot, not that you deserve it.Your friend, Mr. Wonka, done a deal with Mr. Slugworth.What?Gave up on his dream to settle your accounts.Mr. Crunch.Present.You’re free to go.Scram, bookworm.[Mrs. Scrubitt] Bell.[Lottie] Hello.[Mrs. Scrubitt] Sling yer hook.Benz.You ain’t gotta tell me twice.

You’ve got something.You scare me.[Mrs. Scrubitt] And finally, Noodle.Biggest pile o’ the lot.But this isn’t to pay your bill.This is to keep you here.[door shuts]What do you mean?[door locks][Mrs. Scrubitt] My friend, Mr. Slugworth, doesn’t think nasty little urchins like you should be out on the streets, lowering the tone.So, he gave me this money to keep you down in the Wash House for good.And I’m only too happy to oblige.I hate you![Bleacher] Hey!Hey, hey, hey.[Mrs. Scrubitt laughs]Look at her go, Lord Bleachowitz.[both laugh]Lord Bleachowitz?You don’t still think he’s a lord, do you?What?We made it up, you stupid old hag.[Bleacher] She’s… she’s lying.Right, that’s it, you horrible little brat.You’re goin’ in the coop, my girl.And you!

I thought you’d gone.I did.Slugworth promised you a better life, but he didn’t exactly keep his side of the bargain.So I came back. We all did.[Piper] Hey, Noodle.[Abacus] How do?[Lottie] Hey.[Larry gurgling] Surprise![Noodle] He wants me locked up forever.Yeah, well, that figures.Why? What’s he got against me?I don’t know, Noodle. Not for sure.All I know for certain is that you won’t be safe until Slugworth is behind bars.[footsteps approaching]And how exactly is that supposed to happen?Abacus. You said the Cartel keep a record of all their dirty deeds.In the green ledger, yes.[Willy] So if we can get hold o’ that, we can prove that they poisoned our chocolate.Scrubitt and Bleacher would go to jail, and we’ll all be free.Uh, yes, but may I remind you, they keep that ledger in a vault.Guarded by a corrupt cleric.And 500 chocoholic monks.[group] Mmhmm.That’s all true.But I went for a long, cold swim this morning.Cold water is very good for the brain.Stimulates the neural pathways.And after just four miles, it came to me.How an ingenious orphan, an accountant, a plumber, a telephone exchange operator, and a man who can speak underwater, could combine those talents, and pull off the heist of the century.But even if we do get our hands on that ledger, the Cartel will simply bribe their way out of trouble.It’s what they do.[sighs][Noodle] The greedy beat the needy, Willy.It’s just the way of the world.[Willy] You’re right, Noodle.I guess that’s why there’s one other thing to do.What’s that?[softly] Change the world.[Piper] Whoa![chuckles]Where do we start?[bell tolling][knocks rhythmically][in English accent] ‘Scuse me, sir.Could you spare a piece of chocolate for a starvin’ orphan?I’m sorry, my child.

Floor it!Yes, sir![flamingos honking][officer] Idiot![breathing heavily]Anything?Nothing.Well, keep looking.[Noodle] It’s not in here, Willy.[Willy] But Abacus said that it was here.[Noodle] Abacus has been in the Wash House for the past four years.Maybe all the scrubbing has gone to his head.‘Cause all that’s down here is just a bunch of stupid old chocolate.[gasps][gasps]Willy, look!We did it, Noodle.We got ’em.[Noodle chuckles][gunshot][Slugworth] Naughty, naughty, Mr. Wonka.You’ve caused us quite a bit of trouble.You and your urchin.Yeah, but she’s not just an urchin, is she, Mr. Slugworth?[gasps]You’re family.[Noodle] What?What are you talking about, Willy?You know that ring, Noodle?The one your parents gave you?Mr. Slugworth has one just like it.Don’t you, Mr. Slugworth?As a matter of fact, I do.That belonged to my brother. Zebedee.Was he my father?A hopeless romantic is what he was.Fell in love with a common little bookworm, died before they could marry.Leaving me sole heir to the family fortune.Or so I thought.But nine months later, your mother turned up on my doorstep, begging me to get a doctor for her sick little newborn.I said I would help.[Noodle] But you didn’t. Did you?[Slugworth] Oh, no.[Noodle] Instead, you put me down a laundry chute.[Slugworth] Bye-bye, baby.[Noodle] Mrs. Scrubitt found me.She saw the ring.Thought it was an “N,” and called me Noodle.But it wasn’t.It was “Z.” For Zebedee.[Slugworth] Well, quite.When your mother returned, I told her you had died.[sobbing] Oh, no![Slugworth] She was heartbroken, of course.But, uh, I gave her a handful of sovereigns and had her escorted from my property.What was her name?Eh?My mom. What was her name?Ooh.Let me see. Um…No, I don’t think I could remember that.[chuckling] Sorry. But you have to understand, she was very poor.[Fickelgruber gags]Sorry, Felix.[Willy] Her name was Dorothy.Dorothy Smith. It says so right here.Dorothy? [chuckles][Willy] Well, what do you know?I guess you did teach me to read after all.[chuckles][Slugworth] Well, this is all very touching, but back to business.We’ll take that, thank you.How much chocolate do you have at your factory, Mr. Fickelgruber?Oh, about 80,000 gallons.Prodnose?[mumbles][Prodnose] Seventyfive?[Slugworth] And I’ve got 150.That should be enough.For what?Death by chocolate.[lights buzz][chocolate bubbles]On you go.Uh, gentlemen.Considering the situation, I wondered if you’d do a good deed on my behalf.A what?“A good deed.”It’s a sort of pointless act of selflessness…Yes, of course, Mr. Wonka.What would you like us to do?I was wondering if you could give this to someone.Only if you happen to see him.And who is it?A little orange man.Eh?A little orange man.About eight inches high, with orange skin and bright green hair.I owe him a jar of chocolates, you see. And, well, I think these might be the best I ever made.Well, in that case, I’ll make sure he gets them personally.Farewell, Mr. Wonka.Urchin.[whirring][heavy thudding][Noodle gasps] Willy…[handles squeaking][chocolate gurgling]What are we gonna do, Willy?I don’t know, Noodle. I’ll think of something.[elevator dings]Best chocolate he ever made, eh?[Prodnose chuckling excitedly]Whoohoo.Oh![chocolate bubbling][Willy] I got it![Noodle] What is it? Did you think of something?[Willy] Yes, I did.If we’re gonna drown in chocolate, Noodle, and let’s face it, we’re gonna drown in chocolate, then it’s gonna be Wonka chocolate.We’re not gonna drown, Willy. Look, there’s a light.We’ll let the chocolate lift us up, we’ll bang on the glass, and pray somebody hears us.That’s a much better idea.[elevator dings]Ah, gentlemen.It was a bit of a close shave this morning, and I was wondering if perhaps we could rethink our arrangement. Or…Or… just leave things as they are.[Slugworth] Father.Well, Wonka might be as nutty as a fruitcake, but he sure knew how to make chocolate.[Father Julius] Mmm.But do you think we should have saved some for the Little Orange Man?Tell me you’re joking.Uh, yes. Yes, I am. Sorry, why am I?[Slugworth] Because there’s no such thing as a little orange man, ya nincompoop.[Willy grunting][Willy] Help! [Noodle] Help![Willy] Somebody help, please!Please help!Help!Look. Look, somebody’s coming. Look.Willy, we’re saved![Noodle panting]I’m sorry, Noodle.Don’t be.You found my family.A mom who loved me.That’s all I ever wanted.Deep breath now.[both inhale deeply][Father Julius] Mmm! Exquisite.You mustn’t let yourself get so worked up.It’s just a bit of chocolate.[door opens][Oompa Loompa] Correction.It was actually my chocolate.[elevator dings]You have made a very grave error, gentlemen.You steal from an Oompa Loompa, we take back a thousandfold.[chocolate draining][both gasping for air]What’s going on, Willy?It’s draining, Noodle.We’ve been saved!By who?I don’t know.By the Little Orange Man! [chuckling]Look.Wh…[Willy] The Little Orange Man![screaming] Thank you, Little Orange Man! Thank you![Willy cheering][Noodle squealing][both cheering][siren ringing][brakes screech]Gentlemen. Thank goodness you’re okay.I came as fast as I could.[chief grunting]Whew! Car shrunk.[Slugworth] I’m sure it did.And you’ve nothing to worry about, Chief.All under control.A couple of thieves broke in, but I’m afraid they met with a little… accident.In which they died.[Prodnose chuckling][chuckling] That’s actually rather good, Gerald.[Willy] I wouldn’t be so sure about that.Officer, would you kindly take a look at this?Wonka![Noodle] It details every single illegal payment these men have ever made.Thousands of them.[scoffs] Affable, don’t listen to her. She’s lyin’.Well, of course, she is. [chuckles nervously][Affable] She’s not, sir.She’s absolutely right.It’s incredible.Oh. Well.Then that sounds like a case for the Chief of Police. [chuckles]So you give it to me, Affable, I’ll, uh… I’ll take it off your hands.You know, save you the paperwork.I can’t do that, I’m afraid, sir.[chuckles] Why’s that?Because your name is written down here.Huh?A lot.Gentlemen…[Affable] You’re under arrest.[Slugworth] Run.[chief] We puttin’ handcuffs on, here?[gasps]That’s okay, Noodle.Give it one second.[Cartel exclaiming][Prodnose] What’s happening?Why are we airborne?[Willy] You didn’t eat any of those chocolates, did you, Mr. Slugworth?Why?[Willy] Because they’re Hoverchocs.Delayed action, but extra',\n",
       "  ' strong.[Slugworth] You think you’re very clever, don’t you, Wonka?Well, there’s a billion sovereigns of chocolate beneath our feet.We’ll get the best lawyers, bribe the judge, rig the jury if we have to.We’ll be fine.I wish I’d thought of that.Hey, Noodle![metal banging][handles squeaking][ground rumbling][crowd exclaiming][all yell][Prodnose] What is that?[Slugworth crying] It’s our chocolate![Fickelgruber] All our chocolate![Prodnose] We’re ruined![Willy] Hey, don’t worry, gentlemen.You’ll come down eventually.Probably. I think.But until then, ladies and gentlemen, Willy Wonka and friends…[laughing]…invite you to enjoy our chocolate.[woman] Yay! Magic Wonka![Basil chuckling]Gwennie?Basil!
